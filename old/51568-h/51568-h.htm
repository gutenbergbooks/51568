<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> selecting a series of ghost stories for this volume
I have taken the greatest care to make use of those
only which are thoroughly well authenticated.</p>

<p>The result of this discrimination has been that
the majority of these accounts of psychic phenomena
have been taken from the lips of eye-witnesses and
transferred to manuscript in as nearly as possible
the narrator’s own language.</p>

<p>First-hand narratives of unfamiliar hauntings,
albeit they refer to the meaner class of houses, will,
I think, be more welcome to the reader than the
mere repetition of such hackneyed stories as those
appertaining to Glamis Castle, the Tower of
London, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In one other point, too, this work may be said to
differ from others dealing with the same subject—viz.,
it is compiled and written by a very keen
psychic—one who has not only investigated (and
lectured on) haunted houses, but has himself seen
many occult manifestations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>As there have been several libel cases quite
recently in connection with the alleged haunting
of houses, I have been obliged (save where it is
stated to the contrary) to give fictitious names to
both people and localities.</p>

</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">One</span> afternoon in the July of this year I took tea
with Lady <span class="nobreak">B——</span> at her club in the West End.
Lady <span class="nobreak">B——</span> is a very old friend of mine, our friendship
dating back to the days when I wore Eton
collars and a preparatory school cap. She was in
unusually high spirits at the thought of a cruise in
the Baltic, whilst I was equally exuberant at being
once again in London after a very trying sojourn in
a particularly remote and isolated town—a town
renowned for pilchards, pasties and Painters.</p>

<p>Now, there is nothing mean nor petty about Lady
<span class="nobreak">B——</span>; she is generosity itself: so kind, so courteous,
and withal so daintily pretty that to be near her,
even, is to be in Elysium.</p>

<p>Remembering the interest I had always taken in
matters psychical, she had invited several friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
especially to meet me, and it was from one of them—Miss
Charlotte Napier—that I heard the following
story:</p>

<p>“Chancing to be stranded late one night at
Bardsley,” she began, “owing to a slight miscalculation
of the time-table, I had no other resource
than to put up at the Green Bank Hotel in Russell
Street.</p>

<p>“It was a very ordinary hotel; ordinary both in
accommodation and appearance. One part of it—that
in which I slept—possibly dated back to the
Elizabethan period, but the rest—most hideously
renovated—was quite modern.</p>

<p>“Outside my room—No. 56—was a long and
somewhat gloomy corridor connecting the old and
new portions of the house.</p>

<p>“I retired to rest about eleven—closing time—and
had been asleep barely an hour before I awoke with
a start to find the room flooded with a pale, phosphorescent
light.</p>

<p>“The moon shone through my window-panes:
it gleamed with an unearthly whiteness across the
bed, and thence across the room, glancing upon
the panels of the door in such a manner that I was
constrained to follow its course and to fix my gaze
wherever it shone.</p>

<p>“The door was a mass of light: I could see each
crack and scar upon it, even the finger-prints on the
white handle, with painful distinctness. A sudden
sensation of horror overcame me; I would have
given anything to have been able to look elsewhere.
I could not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“All my senses were centred upon the door; it
enchained, it drew me, and as I gazed at it in helpless
awe the sound of footsteps from without suddenly
broke upon my ears. Instantly all my faculties
were on the alert, and I became the victim of a
curious sensation unlike any I had hitherto experienced,
but which I have since learned is the usual
effect of psychic manifestation. I felt the proximity
of the unnatural. An icy coldness stole down my
back, my teeth chattered, my hair seemed to rise on
end, and the violent palpitation of my heart made
me sick and dizzy. My faculties had indeed become
abnormally acute, but my body seemed no longer
alive, and I knew that whatever happened I should
be absolutely incapable of action. My powerlessness
was soon to be put to the test. Sitting bolt upright
in bed, in obedience to an irresistible impulse, I
listened, listened with all my might. What were
those sounds? They were certainly unlike any I
had ever heard before, and the kind of terror they
imparted was hitherto unknown to me. Perhaps
the nearest semblance to the kind of fear I then
felt is the fear inspired by the sight of a lunatic. I
could not stir, I could only wait and listen. The
unnatural nature of the footsteps was emphasised by
the brilliancy of the moonlight—quite an abnormal
feature in itself—and the intense hush, which, stealing
surreptitiously upon the house, obliterated every
other sound.</p>

<p>“The footsteps gradually became interpretative—two
people were rushing headlong down the corridor!</p>

<p>“From the light, flying footsteps of the foremost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and the heavier tread and ever-increasing pace of
the hindermost, I concluded it was a race entailing
vital consequences, and that the fugitive would soon
be caught. Caught! but not, pray Heaven! at my
door.</p>

<p>“What on earth had happened? What could
happen in a well-regulated hotel?</p>

<p>“Fire, robbery, or murder?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Murder!</span> Great drops of sweat broke out upon
my brow at the bare thought.</p>

<p>“The moon shone in, whiter and more coldly than
ever, whilst the steps drew nearer and nearer—so
near, in fact, that I fancied I could detect the sound
of breathing. Short, sharp-drawn gasps of agony
accompanied by easier and more strenuous inhalations.</p>

<p>“Who were the actors in this invisible drama?
Were they both men? I imagined not! Indeed, a
thousand horrible ideas suggested themselves to my
mind—to be interrupted by a terrific crash on the
upper panels of the door that made me all but die
with terror. Never had I suffered as at that
moment. I strove to scream—it was in vain; my
tongue clave to the roof of my mouth; I could
utter no sound.</p>

<p>“The door (which I had taken the precaution to
lock) was unceremoniously burst open, and into the
room rushed a very young and fragile looking man
clad in the costume of a Cavalier of the time of
Naseby, whilst close at his heels there followed a
gigantic Roundhead armed with all the terrible
paraphernalia of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“The tableau was so totally different from anything
I had anticipated, and withal horribly real—so real
that had it been in my power I must inevitably have
raised a hand to interpose.</p>

<p>“Indeed, the wretched fugitive made straight for
my bed, and, falling on his knees beside it, clutched
the counterpane convulsively in his fingers. His
ashy face was so near mine that I not only saw
every feature in it with damning clearness, but I
read the many varied expressions in his eyes.</p>

<p>“They were awful. I read in them despair, terror,
hate, overshadowed in the background by an insatiable
craving for every imaginable vice.</p>

<p>“Yet they were beautiful eyes—beautiful both in
formation and colour—too effeminately beautiful
for a man.</p>

<p>“His hair, which fell in a wild profusion of ringlets
over forehead and shoulders, was of a rich
chestnut hue and most luxuriant.</p>

<p>“He wore neither beard nor moustaches; he was
absolutely clean shaven, and his skin shone with all
the milky whiteness of that of a young woman.</p>

<p>“His features were neatly moulded and extremely
delicate; his hands well shaped and narrow, whilst
his fingers, long and tapering, were crowned with
pellucid filbert nails.</p>

<p>“Attired in the most costly and elegant manner, a
manner that suggested the court fop rather than the
soldier, he formed in every way a marked contrast
to his puritan pursuer. The Roundhead was a huge,
brawny fellow, dressed in a leathern jerkin and
heavy riding-boots—his soiled and muddy clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
betokening the wear and tear of an arduous
campaign.</p>

<p>“His face, always ugly, and naturally, perhaps,
sullen and forbidding, was now positively diabolical;
rage, hatred, and triumph vieing with one another
for supremacy.</p>

<p>“Catching hold of the Cavalier by his silken
tresses, and pulling back his head by brute force, the
Cromwellian slowly and deliberately drew the keen
blade of his knife across the doomed man’s throat.</p>

<p>“The horrid deed—transacted amid the most preternatural
silence—was perpetrated so close to me
that I was obliged to witness every revolting detail,
and although I felt sure the victim was bad and vicious,
I did not think the vileness of his character in any
way justified the atrocity of his assassin.</p>

<p>“The murderer had barely accomplished his
fiendish design before a deadly sickness came over
me, and I fainted.</p>

<p>“On recovering consciousness, the room was
once again in darkness, nor could I discover in the
morning any sign whatever of the awful tragedy.</p>

<p>“On making inquiries in the town, I learned that
the inn was well known to be haunted, other people,
as well as I, having witnessed the same phenomenon,
and that during the recent renovations a skeleton
had been unearthed at the foot of the main staircase.</p>

<p>“I saw it in the local museum, and instantly
identified the costume it wore as the one I had seen
on the hapless fugitive. But—the skeleton was that
of a <span class="lowcap">WOMAN</span>!”</p>

Street, Bristol, I set off to interview the ladies who
were reported to have seen it. I found them (the
Misses Rudd) at home, and on their very graciously
consenting to relate to me their psychical experiences,
I sat and listened to the following story
(told as nearly as possible in the eldest lady’s own
words): “It is now,” she began, “some ten years
since we were the tenants of the house you mention,
but I recollect what I saw there as vividly as if it
were yesterday.</p>

<p>“The house, I must tell you, is very small (only
eight or so rooms), dingy, and in a chronic state of
dilapidation; it stands in the middle of a terrace
with no front garden to speak of, save a few yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of moss-covered tiles, slate-coloured and broken,
whilst its back windows overlooked a dreary expanse
of deep and silent water. Nothing more
dismal could be imagined.</p>

<p>“Still, when we took it, the idea of it being haunted
never for one instant entered our minds, and our
first intimation that such was the case came upon us
like a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>“We only kept one maid, Jane (a girl with dark
hair and pleasant manners), my sisters and I doing
all the cooking and helping with the light work.
The morning on which incident No. 1 happened,
knowing Jane to be upstairs occupied in dusting
the rooms, and my sisters being out, my mother
asked me to go into the kitchen and see if the
stove was all right as ‘there was a smell of
burning.’</p>

<p>“Doing as she bid, I hastened to the kitchen,
where a strange spectacle met my sight.</p>

<p>“Kneeling in front of the stove, engaged apparently
in polishing the fender, was a servant-girl with
<span class="lowcap">RED</span> hair; I started back in astonishment. ‘Who
could she be?’</p>

<p>“Too intent at first to notice my advent, she kept
on at her work, giving me time to observe that she
was wearing a very dirty dress, and that her ‘rag’ of
a cap was quite askew. Satisfied she was not ‘Jane,’
and wondering whether some one else’s maid had
mistaken our kitchen for her own—the houses in
the terrace being all alike—I called out, ‘Who are
you? what do you want?’—whereupon, dropping
the fire-irons with a clatter, she quickly turned round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
displaying an ashen-pale face, the expression on
which literally froze me with horror.</p>

<p>“Never! never had I seen such an awful look of
hopeless, of desperate, of diabolical abandonment
in any one’s eyes as in those of hers when their
glance met mine.</p>

<p>“For some seconds we glared at one another without
moving, and then, still regarding me with a
furtive look from out of the corner of her horrible
eyes, she slowly rose from the hearth, and gliding
stealthily forward, disappeared in the diminutive
scullery opposite.</p>

<p>“Curiosity now overcoming fear, I at once followed.
She was nowhere to be seen; nor was there
any other mode of exit by which she could have made
her departure than a tiny window, some four feet or
so from the floor and directly overlooking the deep
waters of the pond to which I have already alluded.</p>

<p>“Here, then, was a mystery! What had I seen?
Had I actually encountered a phantasm, or was I
but the victim of an exceedingly unpleasant and
falsidical hallucination? I preferred to think the
former.</p>

<p>“Not wishing to frighten my mother, I intended
keeping the incident to myself, writing, however, a
complete account of it in my diary for the current
year, but, a further incident occurring to my youngest
sister within the next few days, I determined to
reveal what I had seen and compare notes.”</p>

<p>The eldest Miss Rudd now concluded, and on my
expressing a desire to hear more, her youngest sister
very obligingly commenced:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had been out shopping in the Triangle one
morning,” she said, “and having omitted to take the
latchkey, I was obliged to ring. Jane answered the
summons. There was nothing, of course, unusual
in this, as it was her duty to do so, but there was
something extremely singular in what appeared at
her elbow.</p>

<p>“Standing close beside—I might almost say,
leaning against her (though Jane was apparently
unaware of it)—was a strange, a <span class="lowcap">VERY STRANGE</span>,
servant-girl, with <span class="lowcap">RED HAIR</span> and the most uncanny
eyes; she had on a bedraggled print dress and a cap
all askew; but it was her expression that most
attracted my attention—it was <span class="lowcap">HORRID</span>.</p>

<p>“‘Oh Jane!’ I cried, ‘whoever is it with you?’</p>

<p>“Following the direction of my gaze, Jane
immediately turned round, and, without a word,
<span class="lowcap">FAINTED</span>.</p>

<p>“That is all. The apparition, or whatever you may
please to call it, vanished, and the next time I saw it
was under different circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Will you be so kind as to relate them?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>Miss Rudd proceeded: “Oh! it is nothing very
much!” she exclaimed, “only it was very unpleasant
at the time—especially as I was all alone.</p>

<p>“You see, mother, being delicate, went to bed early,
my sisters were at a concert, and it was Jane’s ‘night
out.’</p>

<p>“I never, somehow, fancied the basement of the
house; it was so cold and damp, reminding me not a
little of a <span class="lowcap">MORGUE</span> or charnel-house; consequently I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
never stayed there a moment longer than was absolutely
necessary, and on this night in question I
was in the act of scurrying back to the drawing-room
when a gentle tap! tap! at the scullery-window
made me defer my departure. Entering
the back kitchen, somewhat timidly I admit, I saw a
face peering in at me through the tiny window.</p>

<p>“Though the night was dark and there was no
artificial lighting at this side of the house, every
feature of that face was revealed to me as clearly as
if it had been day. The little, untidy cap, all awry,
surmounting the shock-head of red hair now half-down
and dripping with water, the ghastly white
cheeks, the widely open mouth, and the eyes, their
pupils abnormally dilated and full of lurid light, were
more appallingly horrible than ever.</p>

<p>“I stood and gazed at it, my heart sick with terror,
nor do I know what would have happened to me
had not the loud rap of the postman acted like
magic; the <span class="lowcap">THING</span> vanished, and ‘turning tail,’ I fled
upstairs into the presence of my mother. That is all.”</p>

<p>I was profuse in my thanks, and the third Miss
Rudd then spoke:</p>

<p>“My bedroom,” she began, “was on the top
landing—the window over-looking the water. I slept
alone some months after the anecdotes just related,
and was awakened one night by feeling some disgusting,
wet object lying on my forehead.</p>

<p>“With an ejaculation of alarm I attempted to
brush it aside, and opening my eyes, encountered a
ghastly white face bending right over me.</p>

<p>“I instantly recognised it, by the description my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sisters had given, as the phantasm of the red-headed
girl.</p>

<p>“The eyes were <span class="lowcap">TERRIBLE</span>! Shifting its slimy
hand from my forehead, and brandishing it aloft
like some murderous weapon, it was about to clutch
my throat, when human nature would stand it no
longer—and—I fainted. On recovering, I found
both my sisters in the room, and after that I never
slept by myself.”</p>

<p>“Did your mother ever see it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Frequently,” the eldest Miss Rudd replied, “and
it was chiefly on her account we relinquished our
tenancy—her nervous system was completely prostrated.”</p>

<p>“Other people saw the ghost besides us,” the
youngest Miss Rudd interrupted, “for not only did
the long succession of maids after Jane <span class="lowcap">ALL</span> see it,
but many of the subsequent tenants; the house was
never let for any length of time.”</p>

<p>“Then, perhaps, it is empty now?” I soliloquised,
“in which case I shall most certainly experiment
there.”</p>

<p>This proved to be the case; the house was tenantless,
and I easily prevailed upon the agent to loan
me the key.</p>

<p>But the venture was fruitless. Three of us and a
dog undertook it. We sat at the foot of the gloomy
staircase; twelve o’clock struck, no ghost appeared,
the dog became a nuisance—and—we came away
disgusted.</p>

<p>A one-night’s test, however, is no test at all; there
is no reason to suppose apparitions are always to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
seen by man; as yet we know absolutely nothing of
the powers or conditions regulating their appearances,
and it is surely feasible that the unknown
controlling elements of one night may have been
completely altered, may even have ceased to exist
by the next. At all events, that was my opinion. I
was by no means daunted at a single failure. But
it was impossible to get any one to accompany me.
The sceptic is so boastfully eager by day. “Ghosts,”
he sneers, “what are ghosts? Indigestion and
imagination! I’ll challenge you to show me the
house I wouldn’t sleep in alone! Ghosts indeed!
Give me a poker or a shovel and I will scare away
the lot of them.” And when you do show him the
house he always has a prior engagement, or else the
weather is too cold, or he has too much work to do
next day, or it isn’t really worth the trouble, or—well!
he is sure to have some very plausible excuse;
at least, that has been my invariable experience.</p>

<p>There is no greater coward than the sceptic, and
so, unable to procure a friend for the occasion, I did
without one; neither did I have the key of the
house, but—taking French leave—gained admittance
through a window.</p>

<p>It was horribly dark and lonely, and although on
the former occasion I did not feel the presence of
the superphysical, I did so now, the very moment I
crossed the threshold. Striking a light, I looked
around me: I was in the damp and mouldy den
that served as a kitchen; outside I saw the moon
reflected on the black and silent water.</p>

<p>A long and sleek cockroach disappeared leisurely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in a hole in the skirting as I flashed my light in its
direction, and I thought I detected the movement
of a rat or some large animal in the cupboard at the
foot of the stairs. I forthwith commenced a search—the
cupboard was empty. I must have been mistaken.
For some minutes I stood in no little
perplexity as to my next move. Where should I go?
Where ought I to go if my adventure were to prove
successful?</p>

<p>I glanced at the narrow, tortuous staircase winding
upwards into the grim possibilities of the deserted
hall and landings—and—my courage failed.</p>

<p>Here, at least, I was safe! Should the Unknown
approach me, I could escape by the same window
through which I had entered. I felt I dare not! I
really <span class="lowcap">COULD</span> not go any further. Seized with a
sudden panic at nothing more substantial than my
own thoughts, I was groping my way backwards to
the window when a revulsion of feeling made me
pause. If all men were poltroons, how much would
humanity ever know of the Occult? We should
leave off where we began, and it had ever been my
ambition to go—<span class="lowcap">FURTHER</span>.</p>

<p>My self-respect returning, I felt in my pocket for
pencil, notebook and revolver, and trimming my
lamp I mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>A house of such minute dimensions did not take
long to explore; what rooms there were, were
Lilliputian—mere boxes; the walls from which hung
the tattered remnants of the most offensively inartistic
papers were too obviously Jerry built; the
wainscoting was scarred, the beading broken, not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
door fitted, not a window that was not either loose
or sashless—the entire house was rotten, paltry,
mean; I would not have had it as a gift. But where
could I wait to see the ghost? Disgust at my
surroundings had, for a time, made me forget my
fears; these now returned reinforced: I thought of
Miss Rudd’s comparison with a morgue—and
shuddered. The rooms looked ghastly! Selecting
the landing at the foot of the upper storey, I sat
down, my back against the wall—and—waited.</p>

<p>Confronting me was the staircase leading up and
down, equally dark, equally ghostly; on my right
was what might once have been the drawing-room,
but was now a grim conglomeration of bare boards
and moonlight, and on my left was an open window
directly overtopping the broad expanse of colourless,
motionless water. Twelve o’clock struck, the
friendly footsteps of a pedestrian died away in the
distance; I was now beyond the pale of assistance,
alone and deserted—deserted by all save the slimy,
creeping insects below—and the shadows. Yes!
the shadows; and as I watched them sporting phantastically
at my feet, I glanced into the darkness
beyond—and shivered.</p>

<p>All was now intensely suggestive and still, the
road alone attractive; and despite my spartonic
resolutions I would have given much to be out in
the open.</p>

<p>The landing was so cramped, so hopeless.</p>

<p>A fresh shadow, the shadow of a leaf that had
hitherto escaped my notice, now attracted and
appalled me; the scratching of an insect made my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
heart stand still; my sight and hearing were painfully
acute; a familiar and sickly sensation gradually crept
over me, the throbbing of my heart increased, the most
inconceivable and desperate terror laid hold of me:
the house was no longer empty—the supernatural
had come! Something, I knew not, I dare not think
what, was below, and I <span class="lowcap">KNEW</span> it would ascend.</p>

<p>All the ideas I had previously entertained of
addressing the ghost and taking notes were entirely
annihilated by my fear—fear mingled with a horrible
wonder as to what form the apparition would take,
and I found myself praying Heaven it might not be
that of an <span class="lowcap">ELEMENTAL</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowcap">THING</span> had now crossed the hall (I knew this
somehow instinctively) and was beginning to mount
the stairs.</p>

<p>I could not cry out, I could not stir, I could not
close my eyes: I could only sit there staring at the
staircase in the most awful of dumb, apprehensive
agonies. The <span class="lowcap">THING</span> drew nearer, nearer; up, up,
<span class="lowcap">UP</span> it came until I could see it at last—see the shock-head
of red hair, the white cheeks, the pale, staring
eyes, all rendered hideously ghastly by the halo of
luminous light that played around it. This was a
ghost—an apparition—a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</i> phantasm of the
dead! And without any display of physical power—it
overcame me.</p>

<p>Happily for me, the duration of its passage was
brief.</p>

<p>It came within a yard of me, the water dripping
from its clinging clothes, yet leaving no marks on
the flooring. It thrust its face forward; I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it was going to touch me, and tried to shrink away
from it, but could not. Yet it did nothing but
stare at me, and its eyes were all the more horrible
because they were blank; not diabolical, as Miss Rudd
had described them, but simply Blank!—Blank with
the glassiness of the Dead.</p>

<p>Gliding past with a slightly swaying motion, it
climbed upstairs, the night air blowing through the
bedraggled dress in a horribly natural manner; I
watched it till it was out of sight with bated breath—for
a second or so it stopped irresolutely beside an
open window; there was a slight movement as of
some one mounting the sill: a mad, hilarious chuckle,
a loud splash—and then—silence, after which I went
home.</p>

<p>I subsequently discovered that early in the seventies
a servant-girl, who was in service at that house, had
committed suicide in the manner I have just described,
but whether or not she had <span class="lowcap">RED HAIR</span> I have never
been able to ascertain.</p>

<p>P.S.—The Ghost I am informed on very reliable
authority, is still (August 1908) to be seen.</p>

<span class="stl">THE BLACK CLOCK</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot2">

</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">When</span> I was reading for the Royal Irish Constabulary
at that excellent and ever-popular Queen’s
Service Academy in Dublin, I made many friends
among my fellow students, certain of whom it has
been my good fortune to meet in after life.</p>

<p>Quite recently, for example, whilst on a visit of
enjoyment to London, I ran up against T. at Daly’s
Theatre. T, one of the best-hearted fellows who
ever trod in Ely Square, passed in second for the
Royal Irish Constabulary, and is now a District
Inspector in some outlandish village in Connemara.</p>

<p>And again, a summer or two ago, when I was on
the pier at Bournemouth, I “plumped” myself down
on a seat near to “G,” who, although never a very
great friend of mine, I was uncommonly glad to
meet under the circumstances.</p>

<p>But last year I was unusually lucky, chancing to
find, a passenger on the same boat as myself, Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
O’Moore, one of my very best “chums,” from whom
I learned the following story:</p>

<p>“You must know,” he began, as we sat on deck
watching the lofty outlines of St. David’s Head slowly
fade in the distance, “you must know, O’Donnell,
that after leaving Crawley’s I inherited a nice little
sum of money from my aunt, Lady Maughan of
Blackrock, who, dying quite unexpectedly, left the
bulk of her property to my family. My brother Bob
had her estate in Roscommon; Charley, the house
near Dublin; whilst I—lucky beggar that I am—(for
I was head over heels in debt at the time) suddenly
found myself the happy possessor of £20,000 and—a
bog-oak grandfather clock.”</p>

<p>Here I thought fit to interrupt.</p>

<p>“A bog-oak clock!” I exclaimed. “Good gracious
me! what a funny legacy! Had you taken a fancy
to it?”</p>

<p>“I had never even seen it!” O’Moore laughed—then,
looking suddenly serious: “My aunt,
O’Donnell, as I daresay you recollect, was rather
dry and satirical. The clock has not been exactly a
pleasant acquisition to my establishment; so I fancy
she may have bequeathed it to me as a sort of antidote
to the exhilarating effect of £20,000. A sort of
‘bitter with the sweet,’ don’t you know! You appear
astonished! You would like to hear more about the
clock? And you are quite right, too; the history of a
really antique piece of furniture is a million times
more interesting a subject to discuss than a ton of
gold. To begin with, it was almost as new to my
aunt as to me; she had only had it a week before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
she died, and during that brief interval she had made
up her mind to leave it to me. Odd, was it not? I
thought so, too, at her funeral! Now it seems quite
natural; I was her metaphysician, I knew her and
understood her idiosyncrasies better than most
people. She bought the clock for a mere song
from a second-hand furniture dealer in Grafton
Street. I was living at the time near Basingstoke in
a small house—one of those horrible anachronisms,
an up-to-date villa in an old-world village.</p>

<p>“It’s a charming neighbourhood—suited me down
to the ground: flat country (hills tire me to death),
excellent roads (I am fond of riding), trout streams,
pretty meadows, crowds of honeysuckle and that
sort of thing, and, to crown all else, Pines!!! Now,
if there is one scent for which I have a special weakness,
it is that of the pine. I could sit out of doors
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i> sniffing pines. It intoxicates me;
hence I grew very fond of Hampshire.</p>

<p>“Let me return to the clock. It came from
Dublin to Bristol <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> the good old Argo (what
Bristolian is there, I should like to know, who doesn’t
love the Argo!) and thence by rail to Basingstoke,
arriving at my house after dusk. You see, I am
talking of it almost as if it were some live person!
But then, you see, it was a bog-oak grandfather’s clock—no
common grinder I can assure you; and I was
prepared to pay it every homage the moment it was
landed in the hall.</p>

<p>“The carter, however, was by no means so
enamoured of it; he was a rough, churlish fellow
(what British workmen is not?). ‘If you take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
my advice, mister!’ he growled, ‘you’ll pitch the
himpish thing in some one helse’s garden rightaway.’
(How characteristic of the charitable Briton.)</p>

<p>“I gently rebuked the irate man. Of course,
he could afford to be more prodigal with his
belongings than I. With evident haste, and still
muttering angrily, he went—and I—I called to my
housekeeper (Mrs. Partridge), and we examined the
heirloom together.</p>

<p>“It certainly was a most imposing piece of furniture.
Standing at least eight feet high, with a face
large in proportion, it towered above me like a
giant negro—black—I can’t describe to you how
black—black as ebony and shining.</p>

<p>“I asked Mrs. Partridge how she liked it; for, to
tell you the truth, there was something so indefinably
queer about it that I began to wonder if
the carter had spoken the truth.</p>

<p>“‘It is truly magnificent!’ she said, running her
hand over its polished surface, ‘I have never seen
so fine a piece of workmanship! It will be the
making of this hall—but—it reminds me of a
hearse!!!’</p>

<p>“We laughed—the analogy was simply ludicrous.
A grandfather’s clock and a hearse! But then—it
told the Time! and Time is sometimes represented
in the guise of Death! Father Death with the
sickle!</p>

<p>“My laughter left me and I shivered.</p>

<p>“We placed the clock in the right-hand corner of
the hall, opposite the front door, so that every one
coming to the house could see it; and, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
anticipated, it was much admired—so much admired,
in fact, that I became quite jealous—jealous, and of
a clock! How very singular. But then I recollected
I was ‘engaged,’ and, of course, I resented my
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i> taking notice of any one or anything save
myself.</p>

<p>“Like all the other visitors, however, she never
passed by the clock without pausing to look at it.</p>

<p>“‘I can’t help it,’ she whispered. ‘It’s its size! it’s
stupendous! It quite fills the house! there is hardly
any room to breathe! It’s a monstrous clock! It
fascinates me! It’s more than a clock. You must
<span class="lowcap">GET RID</span> of it.’</p>

<p>“Avice was whimsical. What, get rid of the
Ebony Clock! Impossible—the idea tickled me. I
laughed.</p>

<p>“I laughed then—but not later, when she had
gone and all was quiet.</p>

<p>“From the hall below I heard it strike one, two,
three—twelve!</p>

<p>“Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull and
ponderous clang, and the sound that came from its
brazen lungs, though loud and deep and musical,
was far too thrilling.</p>

<p>“Against my will, it made me think, and my
thoughts were none too pleasant.</p>

<p>“Hardly had its vibrations ceased before I sat
up in bed and listened! At first I attributed the
noise I had heard to the pulsations of my heart—bump!
bump! bump!—but as I crouched there,
waiting, I was soon undeceived; the sounds not only
increased in intensity, but drew nearer—bump!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bump! bump!—just as if something huge and
massive was moving across the hall floor and
ascending the stairs!</p>

<p>“An icy fear stole all over me! What!—what
in Heaven’s name could it be?</p>

<p>“I glanced in terror at the door—it was locked—locked
and <span class="lowcap">BOLTED</span>—the village was much frequented
by tramps, and I always went to bed
prepared.</p>

<p>“But this noise—this series of heavy, mechanical
booms—<span class="lowcap">THIS</span> could never be attributed to any
burglar!</p>

<p>“It reached the top of the staircase, it pounded
down the passage leading to my room; and then,
with the most terrific crash, it <span class="lowcap">FELL</span> against my
door!</p>

<p>“I was spellbound—petrified. I dared not—I
<span class="lowcap">COULD NOT</span> move.</p>

<p>“It was the clock! the gigantic, monstrous clock!—the
funereal, hideous clock! I heard it ticking!
The suspicions that I entertained all along with
regard to it were now confirmed—it lived!!!
That was no ordinary striking—<span class="lowcap">THIS</span> was no
ordinary ticking. The thing breathed, it spoke,
it laughed—laughed in some diabolically ghoulish
manner.</p>

<p>“I would have sacrificed my house and fortune
to have been able to reach the bell. I could not. I
could do nothing but sit there listening—listening
to its mocking voice. The minutes passed by
slowly—never had I had the leisure to count them
with such painful accuracy; for the tickings, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of equal duration, varied most alarmingly in
intonation.</p>

<p>“This horrible farce lasted without cessation till
one, when, apparently convinced of its inability to
gain admittance, it gave an extra loud and emphatic
clang and took its departure.</p>

<p>“In the morning it was standing as usual in its
corner in the hall, nor could I detect the slightest
evidences of animation, neither in its glassy face nor
in its sepulchral tone.</p>

<p>“Happening to pass by at that instant, Mrs.
Partridge surprised me in my act of examination,
and from her ashy cheeks and frightened glances I
concluded she, too, had heard the noises and had
rightly guessed their origin. Nor was I mistaken,
for, on putting a few leading questions to her, she
reluctantly admitted she had heard everything.
‘But,’ she whispered, ‘I have kept it from the
maids, for if once they get hold of the idea the
house is haunted they will leave to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, her circumspection proved of
no avail; night after night the clock repeated its
vagaries, bumping on the staircases and passages to
such a degree that the noise not only awakened the
entire household, but aroused general suspicion.</p>

<p>“Nor were its attentions any longer restricted to
me; it gradually extended the length of its wanderings
till every part of the house had been explored
and every door visited.</p>

<p>“The maids now complained to me. ‘They
could not do their work,’ they argued, ‘if they
were deprived of sleep, and sleep was out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
question whilst the disturbances continued. I must
get rid of the clock.’</p>

<p>“To this proposition, however, I was by no
means agreeable. I certainly had no reason to like
the clock—indeed I loathed and hated it—but in
some indefinable manner it fascinated me. I could
not, I dare not part with it. ‘I have no doubt,’ I
protested, ‘the annoyances will cease as soon as the
clock has become at home with its surroundings.
Have patience and all will be well.’</p>

<p>“They agreed to wait a little longer before giving
me notice, and I fully hoped that my prophecy
would be fulfilled. But the clock was far more
persistent than I had anticipated. Adopting fresh
tactics, it began a series of persecutions that
speedily brought matters to a crisis.</p>

<p>“Christina, the cook, was the first victim.</p>

<p>“Not being a very fluent scribe, her letters caused
her endless labour, and she often sat up writing long
after the other servants had gone to bed.</p>

<p>“On the night in question she was plodding on
wearily when the intense stillness of the house
made her suddenly think of the time; it must be
very late! Dare she venture in the hall?</p>

<p>“Christina was not a nervous woman; she had
hitherto discredited all ghost-stories, and was quite
the last person in the house to accept the theory
that the present disturbances were due to any
superphysical agency. She now, however, recollected
all that had been said on the subject, and
the close proximity of the clock filled her with
dread; her fears being further augmented by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
knowledge of her isolation—unluckily her room
was completely cut off from any other in the house.</p>

<p>“Hastily putting away her writing materials, she
was preparing to make a precipitate rush for the
stairs when a peculiar thumping riveted her
attention.</p>

<p>“Her blood congealed, her legs tottered, she could
not move an inch. What was it?</p>

<p>“Her heart—only the pulsations of her heart.</p>

<p>“She burst out laughing. How truly ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Catching her breath and casting fearful looks of
apprehension on all sides, she advanced towards the
stairs and ‘tiptoeing’ stealthily across the hall, tried
in vain to keep her eyes from the clock. But its
sonorous ticking brought her to a peremptory halt.</p>

<p>“She stood and listened. Tick! tick! tick! It
was so unlike any other ticking she had ever heard,
it appalled her.</p>

<p>“The clock, too, seemed to have become blacker
and even more gigantic.</p>

<p>“It reared itself above her like a monstrous coffin.</p>

<p>“She was now too terrified to think of escape, and
could only clutch hold of the bannisters in
momentary terror of some fresh phenomenon.</p>

<p>“In this helpless condition she watched the clock
slowly increase in stature till its grotesquely carved
summit all but swept the ceiling, whilst a pair of huge,
toeless, grey feet protruded from beneath its base.</p>

<p>“Nor were these the only changes, for during
their accomplishment others of an equally alarming
nature had taken place, and the ticking, after having
passed through many transitional stages, was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
replaced by a spasmodic breathing, forcibly suggestive
of something devilish and bestial.</p>

<p>“At this juncture words cannot convey any idea
of what Christina suffered; nor had she seen the
worst.</p>

<p>“Midnight at length came. In dumb agony she
watched the minute-hand slowly make its last
circuit; there were twelve frantic clangs, the door
concealing the pendulum flew open, and an
enormous hand, ashy grey, with long, mal-shaped
fingers, made a convulsive grab at her.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Swinging
to one side, she narrowly avoided capture and,
glancing upwards, saw something so diabolically
awful that her heart turned to ice.</p>

<p>“The face of the clock had disappeared, and in its
place Christina saw a frightful head—grey and evil.
It was very large and round, half human, half
animal, and wholly beastly, with abnormally long,
lidless eyes of pale blue that leered at the affrighted
girl in the most sinister manner.</p>

<p>“Such a creature must have owed its origin to
Hell.</p>

<p>“For some seconds she stared at it, too enthralled
with horror even to breathe; and, then a sudden
movement on its part breaking the spell, she regained
control over her limbs and fled for her life.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span></p>

<p>“Christina reported all this to me the next morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
She had narrowly escaped capture by darting through
the front door which some one, fortunately for her,
had forgotten to bolt. She had not returned to the
house, but had, instead, passed the rest of the night
in a neighbouring cottage.</p>

<p>“‘I won’t, under any circumstances, sir,’ she
added, ‘sleep here again. Indeed, I could not,
because I can’t abide the presence of that clock. I
shan’t feel easy until I am miles away from it—in
some big town, where the bustle and noise of life
may help me to forget it—<span class="lowcap">FORGET</span> it!!’—and she
shuddered.</p>

<p>“Partly as a compensation for what she had
undergone and partly to avoid a scandal, I presented
her with a substantial cheque.</p>

<p>“Despite Mrs. Partridge’s pleadings, I kept the
clock. I could not—I dare not—part with it. It was
my aunt’s bequest—it fascinated me! Do you understand,
O’Donnell?—it fascinated me.</p>

<p>“But I did make one concession: I permitted
them to remove it to the summer-house.</p>

<p>“My first care now was to see that all the doors
were locked, and windows bolted before retiring to
bed; a precaution that was speedily justified.</p>

<p>“For the next few nights after the removal of the
clock I was awakened about twelve by a violent
ringing of the front door bell, whilst a heavy
crunching of the gravel beneath my window
informed me our persecutor was trying to gain
admittance.</p>

<p>“These nocturnal disturbances ceasing, I had
begun to congratulate myself upon having seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
last of the hauntings, when a rumour reached me that
the clock had actually begun to infest the more lonely
of the lanes and by-roads.</p>

<p>“Nor did this report, as the sequel will show, long
remain unverified.</p>

<p>“My uncle John, a rare old ‘sport,’ came to stay
with me. He arrived about ten, and we had not yet
gone to bed when the vicar of the parish burst into
our presence in the greatest state of agitation.</p>

<p>“‘I must apologise for this late visit,’ he gasped,
sinking into an easy chair, ‘I couldn’t get here
before. Indeed, I did not intend calling this evening,
and would not have done so but for an extraordinary
incident that has just happened. Would you think
it very unclerical if I were to ask you for a glass of
neat brandy?’</p>

<p>“I glanced at him in ill-disguised terror. His
blanched cheeks and trembling hands told their own
tale—he had seen the clock.</p>

<p>“‘Thanks awfully,’ he said, replacing the empty
glass on the table. ‘I feel better now—but, by
jove! it <span class="lowcap">DID</span> unnerve me. Let me tell you from
the beginning. I had been calling at Gillet’s Farm,
which, as you know, is two or more miles from here,
and the night being fine, I decided to go home by
the fields. Well! all was right till I got to the little
spinney lying at the foot of Dickson’s Hollow.</p>

<p>“‘Even in broad daylight I always feel a trifle
apprehensive before entering it, as it is often frequented
by tramps and other doubtful characters:
in fact, there isn’t a more murderous looking spot in
the county.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘All was so still, so unusually still I thought, and
the shadows so incomprehensible that I had half a
mind to retrace my steps, but, disliking to appear
cowardly, and remembering, I must confess, that I
had ordered a roast duck for supper, I climbed the
wooden fence and plunged into the copse.</p>

<p>“‘At every step the silence increased, the cracking
of twigs under my feet sounding like the report of
firearms, whilst it grew so dark that I had in certain
places literally to feel my way. When about halfway
through the wood the shrubs that line the path
on either side abruptly terminate, bringing into view
a circle of sward, partially covered with ferns and
bracken, and having in its midst a stunted willow
that has always struck me as being peculiarly out of
place there.</p>

<p>“‘Indeed, I was pondering over this incongruity
when a tall figure stalked out from behind the tree,
and, gliding swiftly forward, took to the path ahead
of me.</p>

<p>“‘I rubbed my eyes and stared in amazement, and
no doubt you will think me mad when I tell you
the figure was nothing human.’</p>

<p>“‘What was it, then—an anthropoid ape?’ my
Uncle John laughed.</p>

<p>“The vicar shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p>“‘I will describe it to you to the best of my ability,’
he said. ‘To begin with it was naked—stark,
staring naked!’</p>

<p>“‘How positively indecent,’ murmured Uncle
John, ‘really vicar, I don’t wonder you were
frightened.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘And then,’ the vicar continued, disregarding
the interruption, ‘it was grey!—from head to foot
a uniform livid grey.’</p>

<p>“‘A grey monstrosity! Ah! now <span class="lowcap">THAT</span> is interesting!’</p>

<p>“I looked at my uncle quizzically—was he still
joking? But no! he was in sober earnest: could it
be possible he knew anything about the clock.</p>

<p>“I leaned back in my chair and smiled—feebly.</p>

<p>“‘In height,’ the vicar went on, ‘it could not
have been far from seven feet, it had an enormous
round head crowned with a black mass of shock
hair, no ears, huge spider-like hands and toeless
feet.</p>

<p>“‘I could not see its face as its back was turned
on me.</p>

<p>“‘Urged on by an irresistible impulse (although
half dead with terror), I followed the Thing.</p>

<p>“‘Striding noiselessly along, it left the spinney, and
crossing several fields entered your grounds by the
gate in the rear of the house.’</p>

<p>“‘What!’ my uncle roared, banging the table with
his fist, ‘what! do you mean to tell me you allowed
it to come here!’</p>

<p>“‘I couldn’t stop it,’ the vicar said apologetically,
stretching forward to help himself to some more
brandy. ‘It led me to your summer-house, vanishing
through the doorway. Resolved on seeing the last, and
hoping thereby to discover some clue to the mystery,
I cautiously approached the window, and, peering
through the glass, saw the creature walk stealthily
across the floor and disappear into a gigantic clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
I verily believe I was as much scared by the sight of
that clock as I had been by the appearance of the
spectre—they were both satanically awful.’</p>

<p>“‘Is that all?’ my Uncle John inquired.</p>

<p>“‘It is,’ the vicar replied, ‘and is it not
enough?’</p>

<p>“My Uncle John got on his feet.</p>

<p>“‘Before returning a verdict,’ he said, ‘I must see
the clock. Let us go to the summer-house at
once.’</p>

<p>“The vicar and I were loud in our protests—‘We
were sure my uncle must be tired; better put off the
investigation to the morrow.’</p>

<p>“It was, however, of no avail; there was no gainsaying
Uncle John when once he had made up his
mind to do anything.</p>

<p>“We accordingly escorted him without further
delay to the garden.</p>

<p>“The clock was standing quite peacefully where I
had had it set.</p>

<p>“As soon as my uncle saw it he caught hold of
my arm. ‘Where on earth did you get it from,
Harry?’ he cried, bubbling over with excitement.
‘The last time I saw that clock was in Kleogh
Castle, the home of the Blakes. It had been in
their possession for centuries, and was made from
what is supposed to be the oldest bog-oak in Ireland.
Ah! the old lady left it you, did she? and you say
she got it from Kelly’s in Grafton Street.</p>

<p>“‘Come! that explains everything. The Blakes—poor
beggars—were sold up last year, and Kelly’s,
I know, were represented at the sale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘But now comes the extraordinary part of the
affair. The grey figure our friend the vicar has just
described to us tallies exactly with the phantasm
that used to haunt Kleogh, and which the Blakes
have always regarded in the light of a family ghost.</p>

<p>“‘Now it would appear that they are entirely
wrong—that it is with the clock and not Kleogh
this apparition is connected—a fact that is not at
all surprising when we come to consider its origin
and the vast antiquity of its frame.</p>

<p>“‘But let us examine it more carefully to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“We did so, and discovered that the frontal pillars
on either side of the face of the clock consisted of
two highly polished femur-bones which, although
blackened through countless ages of immersion in
the bog, and abnormally long (as is inevitably the
case with Paleolithic man), were very unmistakably
human.</p>

</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Bath</span> is a veritable cockpit of Ghostdom; its grey
and venerable mansions abound in ghosts; it is for
its size the most psychic town in England.</p>

<p>I say this because I have at my elbow no less
than twenty-five well authenticated stories of haunted
houses in this city: a collection that is numerically
superior to that of any other town in England,
saving London, and to the ghosts of London there
is, as I stated at my recent lecture in Chandos
Street, no end—positively no end.</p>

<p>One evening last January I read a paper on “My
Superphysical Experiences” before an extremely intelligent,
and, I venture to say, appreciative audience
of Theosophists, at their headquarters, Argyll Street,
Bath.</p>

<p>Among the number was a gentleman—quite a
stranger I believe—who gave me his card and asked
me to call on him next day. I did so, and in the
course of a very entertaining chat he narrated to
me the following story:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some years ago some friends of mine, named
Hartley, took a house in Park Street, which, as you
may know, is built on the side of a hill.</p>

<p>“The house suited them; it was warm, dry, and in
a very tolerable state of repair; it was also in a
quiet and thoroughly respectable part of the town,
and the rent was low—ridiculously low—so low,
indeed, that they began to wonder why it was so
low.</p>

<p>“Anxious to find out if their neighbours were
equally fortunate in the matter of rent, they made
enquiries, and learned to their astonishment that
every other house in the row was let at more than
double the price of theirs.</p>

<p>“Why was this? Was their landlord a philanthropist,
a Carnegie, a madman, or what?</p>

<p>“Or did the house contain some subtle flaw they
were yet to discover to their disadvantage? Perhaps,
very much to their disadvantage; for they were sufficiently
worldly to discredit sentiment in business!</p>

<p>“Getting on the track of former tenants, they plied
them with cautious questions; it was of no avail,
the bait did not take; they could ascertain nothing.
Then they gave up—and the truth at last leaked
out.</p>

<p>“One dreary afternoon in a particularly dreary
November, I believe it was the fourth of November,
the Rev. Silas Wetherby, vicar of an adjoining Parish,
called on them.</p>

<p>“They were delighted to see him; Mrs. Hartley
was fond of the clergy; her father and uncles
and brothers were all in the Church; she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
lived in a clerical atmosphere from the day she
was born.</p>

<p>“But the Rev. Silas Wetherby puzzled her. Had
he been a deacon, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locum</i>, or a newly ordained
curate, she would have passed him over as excusably
shy; but he was too old a stager for that. Why did
he puzzle her, then? He was orthodox, urbane,
and—she would stake her handkerchief—no small
tatler of ecclesiastical gossip, but yet there was
something amiss with him, something that made
him pause, something that made him fidget.</p>

<p>“Probably she never would have found out why
he behaved in such an odd manner but for an unexpected
occurrence.</p>

<p>“Without even as much as a rap, Bobby, their
youngest boy, who is, as a rule, very shy before
visitors, suddenly burst into the room. He was
pale with excitement.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, do come, mummy,’ he cried, ‘there is such
a queer old man in such a quaint dress on the
staircase. He is coughing horribly. I fancy he
must be very sick. Do come, mummy—please.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Wetherby’s behaviour was now odd in the
extreme. Half rising from his seat and trembling
all over, he pointed his finger violently at the door.</p>

<p>“‘Run away, little man,’ he said, ‘run away!
No one is coughing now. Your invalid has recovered,
he is gone. Go directly, and shut the door
behind you. Mind—shut the door, and keep clear
of the staircase,’ and Bobby, completely at a loss
what to make of this despotic stranger, beat a hasty
retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Hartley, disregarding the pleading look
from her husband, was about to expostulate; like the
majority of modern mothers, her tender—might I
add unsound—sensibilities could not bear to see
her offspring treated in any but the most deferential
manner.</p>

<p>“The Rev. Silas, however, forestalled her. With
a wave of his hand that was as eloquent as it was
peremptory he completely took the wind out of her
sails, and before she had time to recover from her
surprise he had commenced:</p>

<p>“‘For Heaven’s sake, Mrs. Hartley!’ he said in a
semi-whisper, leaning forward in such a manner as
emphasised the mysterious air he had suddenly
assumed, ‘for Heaven’s sake! leave this house as
quickly as you can!’</p>

<p>“‘There now, Arthur!’ Mrs. Hartley exclaimed,
the angry expression in her eyes being replaced by
a mixture of triumph and curiosity—‘There now!
didn’t I tell you all along something was wrong with
the place?’</p>

<p>“‘Drains, I suppose!’ her husband said mournfully,
‘drains or rats!—and I do hate moving.’</p>

<p>“‘Neither one nor the other!’ the Rev. Silas
whispered. ‘No! the house is haunted.’</p>

<p>“At this announcement Mrs. Hartley gave a slight
ejaculation of terror—an ejaculation which, reduced
to its constituent parts, might be found to consist of
affectation, fear, and no small amount of pleasure,
the latter engendered by the glamour of something
both <span class="lowcap">ENIGMATICAL</span> and <span class="lowcap">FASHIONABLE</span>.</p>

<p>“‘What’s it haunted by? Teapots?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>’ Mr. Hartley
muttered with a contemptuous movement of his
mouth. ‘If it’s not haunted by teapots now, it will
be some day, for that new maid of yours, my dear,
is always breaking them. She has smashed two
since yesterday, and if you examine this one closely
you will observe that the spout is already chipped.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hartley puckered her dainty brows into the
most alarming frown.</p>

<p>“‘Really, Arthur! how mundane you are,’ she
remarked loftily; then, turning to Mr. Wetherby,
‘My husband is, as you see, one of those solid
individuals who believes in nothing till he sees it.’</p>

<p>“‘And not always then,’ Arthur murmured, gazing
intently at the parson as the latter was about to
pour the contents of the cream-jug into his cup.
‘Everything that appears to the eye white and
sticky is not cream! Some animals have brains,
even pigs—and some dairymen are frauds—most
of them!’</p>

<p>“‘Good gracious me!’ the Rev. Silas cried hastily
replacing the jug. ‘You surely don’t mean to <span class="nobreak">insinuate——’</span></p>

<p>“‘He doesn’t mean anything!’ Mrs. Hartley
interrupted with considerable impatience, ‘he is
unusually silly this afternoon—so pray excuse him!’
and—with the regular six-months-in-Paris accent—‘revenons
à nos moutons, s’il vous plait. I am
anxious to hear about the ghost.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Wetherby looked a trifle sulky; he fought
shy of sceptics, and he no longer enjoyed his tea.</p>

<p>“‘Now, mind I don’t ask you to believe me!’ he
began, ‘although there are plenty of people in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
parish who will confirm what I say; but eighty, or a
hundred or so years ago, a son poisoned his father
in this very house.</p>

<p>“‘The manner of the poisoning was quite orthodox—arsenic
in apple dumplings. There have been
many parallel cases, chiefly, I believe, in Liverpool.</p>

<p>“‘Arsenic being an irritant, causes considerable
vomiting, hence the old man must have had several
attacks of sickness prior to the one that terminated
his existence as he was travelling downstairs to fetch
a doctor. He died, it is said, in excruciating agony
on the landing at the top of the first flight of
stairs.’</p>

<p>“‘And it is his ghost that haunts the house?’
Mrs. Hartley hazarded.</p>

<p>“The Rev. gentleman nodded. ‘Just so,’ he said,
‘and it was this apparition, undoubtedly, that your
little boy saw just now. It always appears on
November 4, the anniversary of the murder, and—’
Mr. Wetherby was going to add something that,
judging from the increased solemnity of his voice,
would have been very impressive, when Mr.
Hartley cut in: ‘Then at all events we shall have
a reprieve, a year’s undisputed possession, subject
to no interference on the part of the spook—Mr.
Whatever’s his name.’ He laughed irreverently,
‘You certainly won’t catch me giving up this lease
for any so immaterial a reason. No, thank you!
I cannot get as good a bargain as this every day in
the week!’</p>

<p>“The Rev. Silas rose to go. ‘Very well then!’ he
said, bowing stiffly, ‘I could say more—but I won’t!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I am sorry I have said as much. Some sceptics are
never convinced! Some sceptics do not wish to be
convinced! Some sceptics may be convinced, but
prefer to appear unconvinced!</p>

<p>“‘I am no metaphysician! I will not attempt to
classify <span class="lowcap">YOU</span>. I will only say, “May you never be
<span class="lowcap">AFRAID</span>.”</p>

<p>“‘I trust Mrs. Hartley, at all events, is not a
sceptic: I hope she is not a psychic! especially not
a psychic in this house. I wish you good day!’</p>

<p>“‘He did not wish us good luck!’ Mr. Hartley
explained as the door banged. ‘By Jove! I have no
patience to listen to such stuff! Haunted, indeed!’</p>

<p>“But his wife shook her head. ‘Scepticism is one
thing, and what Bobbie saw is another!’ she argued.
‘You can’t get over that, Arthur! Now, are we
doing the right thing for the children in remaining
here?’</p>

<p>“In all matters concerning her children Mrs.
Hartley’s instincts were always acute—one or two
of them were babies, even younger than Bobbie.</p>

<p>“On this occasion, however, Mr. Hartley held his
own. ‘<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>,’ he reasoned, ‘must have had
the daymare, and even if he did see anything, no
harm has come of it. You must recollect, my
dear,’ he observed, ‘that I have not been doing
over-well on the Stock Exchange lately; moving is
a costly thing, and if I spend money in one way,
I must recoup in another, which means no new
dress for you and no Weston-super-Mare for the
children.’</p>

<p>“The validity of this logic was not lost upon Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Hartley. She reflected; and then with her customary
adroitness gave a turn to the conversation.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span></p>

<p>“It was once again November, the fourth of
November, and the staircase incident of a year
ago now seemed remote and improbable. It was,
however, uppermost in the minds of both Mr. and
Mrs. Hartley, though they both pretended to have
forgotten it.</p>

<p>“They had neither seen Mr. Wetherby again, nor
had they mentioned the appearance of the ghost to
anyone. It was really of so little consequence.</p>

<p>“It was a wet afternoon—wet and chilly, and as
neither Mr. or Mrs. Hartley had any particular
inducement to face the elements, they decided to
stay indoors, Mrs. Hartley reclining in an easy chair
before the drawing-room fire whilst her husband
seated himself in like manner before a blazing hearth
in the dining-room.</p>

<p>“They tried to read—they could not; they tried to
sleep—they could not: and somehow they felt that
they ought to go and look at the children—but they
would not; and so they whiled away the hours in
this half-hearted and wholly unsatisfactory manner.</p>

<p>“It seems the sudden opening of the nursery door
first disturbed Mrs. Hartley, and fancying she heard
someone steal gently across the landing, she called
out; there was no reply, so, thinking it was fancy,
she was about to settle down again when the sound
of some one coughing made her heart beat quickly.</p>

<p>“Who could it be? Not the nurse! The nurse
wouldn’t cough in such a deep and hoarse manner!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
nor yet Arthur; she would recognise his cough anywhere.
Hark! there it was again—cough! cough!
cough! just as if some one was being sick. Someone
being sick! Ah! who could that someone be? who
indeed? but—and fearing lest one of the children
might be on the stairs, she overcame a momentary
weakness and sallied forth.</p>

<p>“What she saw froze her with horror.</p>

<p>“At the top of the hall staircase was the figure of a
man clad in the costume of the eighteenth century,
viz., long maroon tail-coat with vest to match,
knee breeches, and coarse yellow stockings. Mrs.
Hartley couldn’t see his face, as he was in a recumbent
position and vomiting horribly. Looking up at him
from below, her eyes big with pity and wonder—not
fear—was Kitty, the Hartley’s youngest child.</p>

<p>“Catching sight of her mother, Kitty cried, ‘Oh!
mummy, do tum down! the poor man is awful ill.
Do help him! I’ll tum too,’ and suiting the action
to her words the little mite prepared to ascend. No
sooner, however, had she set a foot on the staircase
than the old man slipped, and, falling sideways,
plunged through the air.</p>

<p>“Making sure Kitty would be hurt, and regardless of
the fact that she was merely clutching at a phantom,
Mrs. Hartley appears to have made frantic efforts to
stay the disaster. Whether in her agitation she tried
to go down the stairs too quickly, or whether in her
anxiety to save her child she lost her head and simply
leaped forward, it is impossible to say; she herself
always declares that the stairs ‘collapsed’ under
her. Anyhow, she fell, and crashing into Kitty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
literally crushed the life out of her. Mr. Hartley
found mother and child lying together at the foot of
the stairs, and although he saw no sign of any apparition,
he is no longer a sceptic.</p>

<p>“His wife recovered—at least, she is alive—though
I am told some internal complaint—the result of the
catastrophe—makes her long for death.</p>

<p>“Some months after Kitty’s burial, when time had
to a certain extent mollified the poignancy of suffering
caused by her death, Mr. Hartley received a
letter of condolence from the Rev. Silas Wetherby.</p>

<p>“The greater portion of the epistle was simply a
formal declaration of sympathy, but the concluding
lines, inasmuch as they bear on the haunting, are
worth repeating.</p>

<p>“The worthy divine wrote as follows:</p>

<p>“‘If you recollect, at our last meeting I gave you
to understand that I had something further to tell
you <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">re</i> the occult disturbances in your late abode.</p>

<p>“‘You will probably treat my statement with contempt,
badly concealed under cover of a pretty
pasquinade, but I am prepared to run the gauntlet
of your scepticism in order to relieve my conscience.</p>

<p>“‘What I would have told you had I not been
silenced (culpably I own) by your ridicule, is this:
the appearance of the sick man had always been
followed by some dire calamity, whenever any
attempt has been made to set even as much as one
foot on the staircase during the manifestations—hence
my warning to Bobbie.</p>

<p>“‘I cannot, of course, explain to you why a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
phenomenon of this sort should entail physical
disaster any more than I can elucidate the mystery of
the Ghost Candles of Wales, or the Banshees of
Ireland, between which manifestations and the phenomena
in question there is a strong analogy. But
should you feel sufficiently interested in the subject
to ask for further information, or even be sufficiently
dubious to demand testimony, I will with
pleasure provide you with an abundance of creditable
corroborations both documentary and oral.’</p>

<p>“But Mr. Hartley was perfectly satisfied.”</p>

<p class="add">
<span class="add1">Hotel Rietz, Vienna.</span><br />
<span class="add2">Feb. 10, 1908.</span>
</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. O’Donnell</span>,</p>

<p class="ind1">In reply to your inquiry as to that psychic
experience I had in Devon, I will do my best to
make the affair explicit, although, as you know very
well, I do not pose as a scribe.</p>

<p>Well! it took place three years ago—June 15th,
1905—shall I ever forget the date! My friends, the
Maitlands had only just taken “The Minery,” a
pretty yellow stone villa, modern in every respect.
It stood some few yards away from the road and was
fronted by a lawn, bordered with honeysuckle, sweet-peas
and Devon roses.</p>

<p>I tell you this to impress upon you the fact that
there was positively nothing suggestive of ghosts
either in the grounds or building, the latter being as
unlike the orthodox haunted house as one can well
imagine. If anything should have warned me it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was the hesitating and half nervous manner (so
unlike herself) with which Dora Maitland showed
me my room.</p>

<p>“I do hope you will like it and be comfortable,
dear!” she said as she stood for a moment on the
threshold, a strangely perplexing expression in her
eyes, and one which I couldn’t then interpret. “Be
sure to tell us if you <span class="lowcap">DON’T</span> and we will have you
moved at once.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?” I asked in unfeigned astonishment.
“It is delightfully snug and sunny—a south
aspect—a charming view and—oh! the most delightful
of dainty furniture. Why, Dora! I should
indeed be an ungrateful Sybarite if I didn’t revel in
it.” And Dora forced a smile.</p>

<p>The hot summer days drove us into the open: we
got up early and went to bed late. Being a man,
and fond of cricket and fishing, you would hardly
appreciate the life we led. We are women of the
old school, and consequently spent all our time at
home on the lawn, plying our needles, possibly at
the same time chewing chocolates or discussing our
favourite books; motoring and golf we left to others.</p>

<p>The 15th of June was warm and sultry; we had
been invited to spend the evening at the adjoining
vicarage; Dora had a headache, her mother was a
chronic invalid, and so—willy-nilly—I went alone.</p>

<p>It was a stupid affair: mediocre music, still more
mediocre supper—and—<span class="lowcap">BRIDGE</span>!</p>

<p>Fancy Bridge in a sleepy country Parsonage,
fancy Bridge anywhere! I hate Bridge!</p>

<p>The guests were of the usual sort, prudish, prosy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and plain; a widow and twins, the Miss Somebodies
of Somewhere; a curate, a doctor and a
lawyer! What (with the exception of the last) could
be more respectable, what more dull—deadly dull?</p>

<p>They were all (the men, I mean) very anxious I
should play cards, but for once in a way I made
myself positively disagreeable—and sat—alone!</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock came. It was time to go! I rose
with alacrity, omitting, I believe, in the intensity of
joy, the formal expressions of regret.</p>

<p>The vicar accompanied me as far as the gates;
bidding me a bland good-night, he retraced his steps
with a sigh of relief. Mrs. Maitland had left a light
burning in the hall. I turned it out, and taking up
my candle proceeded to my bedroom and was beginning
to undress when a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>My bedroom door (which I felt positively certain
I had locked) slowly opened and a man peered in.</p>

<p>I can see him now—strong, regular features with
piercing dark and somewhat sinister eyes that were
in marked contrast to the iron-grey brows and
wavy, neatly parted hair. The chin was square, the
head well shaped; he was a handsome man, yet he
did not please me!</p>

<p>I was frightened.</p>

<p>For some seconds he glanced furtively round the
room, his eyes finally resting on the bedstead, which
he regarded in a manner that made my flesh creep!
Who could he be? what on earth did he want?</p>

<p>Terrified lest he should see me—though why it
was he hadn’t done so I couldn’t for the life of me
imagine—I kept shrinking backwards, backwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
into the alcove where I hung my dresses, in the wild
hope that they would afford me a safe hiding-place.</p>

<p>Presently, to my unutterable relief, he disappeared,
and I heard his footsteps tiptoeing gently down the
staircase.</p>

<p>Here then was my chance of escape! Hardly
daring to breathe, I rushed frantically to the door
(Heaven preserve me!—it was locked again!) and
tearing it open, I made directly for the passage
leading to Dora’s room.</p>

<p>On my way I heard a noise—a noise that fascinated
and kept me still—the clanging of a bucket.</p>

<p>What could a man be doing with a bucket at this
time of night—a bucket!—and on that staircase so
daintily furnished with velvet pile?</p>

<p>Breathlessly I watched him ascend, his step light
and springing, his head bent low, and the bucket
clanging each time he mounted—clang! clang!
clang!</p>

<p>The agony I suffered—for I could now only conclude
he was either a madman or burglar—was
indescribable; I dreaded above all things the act of
being seen—of encountering a glance from those
evil eyes.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer he came! One more step, and
he stood on the little lobby outside my bedroom
door. What was he going to do—to enter my room
or follow me?</p>

<p>My heart stood still; a cold sweat burst out all
over me; I essayed to shriek and implore the aid of
Dora; my throat dried up, my tongue stuck to the
palate of my mouth—I was speechless! helpless!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hopeless! Another yard, and the uncanny stranger
would have me in his clutches.</p>

<p>At the crucial moment Heaven heard my silent
prayer; he halted, I was saved! With one hand
on the handle, he slowly—very slowly—opened the
door, and crouching down on his hands and feet,
crept quietly in, muffling the sound of the bucket.</p>

<p>Incongruous sight!—a man, a madman, or a
burglar with a common, an every-day bucket, and
in the ecstasies of salvation I gave a weak,
hysterical laugh!—a madman with a bucket! and
what a bucket!</p>

<p>After this little display of emotion, and being now
in the full possession of all my motive faculties, I
promptly fled, not pausing for the fraction of a
second till I had reached the bedside of Dora and
had shaken her to wakefulness. She listened to my
story with blanched cheeks, beseeching me with
terror in her eyes to make sure the door was locked
and that her Bible was well in evidence.</p>

<p>Her fears adding to my own, for I now concluded
that there was some horrible mystery attached to
what I had just witnessed, I hastily scrambled into
bed, and, drawing the clothes well over our heads,
begged her to confide in me the secret.</p>

<p>“I hardly know how to explain it, Kate,” she
whispered, “you will be so shocked! and I’m afraid
you will blame us horribly for putting you in that
room; but, to tell you the truth, we had nowhere
else—at least nowhere suitable, as the ceilings and
walls are sadly out of repair.</p>

<p>“You see, we bought this house at a very low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
price; it had stood empty for a good many months,
was in a sad state of dilapidation, and the owner was
only too glad to get rid of it.</p>

<p>“After we had settled in, he coolly informed us
that it was reputed to be haunted; that the remains
of a woman had been found under the cement of
the back-kitchen floor (it is now nicely tiled), and
that on the anniversary of its committal the tragedy
was reported to be re-enacted in all its grim
details.”</p>

<p>“And was she murdered in my room?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“It is supposed so,” Dora murmured. “There
is a tell-tale stain (which nothing will efface) under
the carpet—and—former tenants are reported to
have seen all you have witnessed, and rather more.”</p>

<p>“And the murderer! what of him?” I asked,
thinking with a shudder of his eyes.</p>

<p>“No one knows anything!” Dora whispered,
edging closer to me as we heard a distant clang.
“It is only surmised he was her husband—she was
quite a stranger here—and—he was never caught.”</p>

<p>“But the bucket, what could he want with such
an absurd thing as a bucket?” and as I heard it
clanging from below I gave a ghastly chuckle.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake don’t laugh!” Dora shivered.
“They found that bucket—he had used it for transporting
her remains!”</p>

</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> following story was related to me by Miss
Constance Delaunay, and is given as near as possible
in her own words:</p>

<p>“The early spring of 1898 was, I daresay you
remember, exceptionally fine—so fine, indeed, that
my mother, a chronic sufferer from rheumatism,
determined to remain in England instead of going,
as was her custom, to the Riviera.</p>

<p>“We did not want, however, to stay in town, an
unusually gay Christmas having given us an appetite
for the country; so we sub-let our flat and took
Thurlow Hall, furnished, on a three months’ lease.</p>

<p>“We had never been to Devon; we had heard
much of its beauty; we were disappointed.</p>

<p>“Possibly, being of foreign extraction, I am prejudiced,
but in my opinion the scenery of Devon is
almost, if not quite, as inferior to that of Belgium
and Switzerland as the manners of its peasants are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
inferior to those of the corresponding class of
Continentals.</p>

<p>“The West Country rustics did not impress us
favourably; on our arrival they welcomed us with
gapes and stares and boorish grunts; not a few of
them giggled, whilst others, slouching up to our
boxes, read the labels and muttered disparaging
things about foreigners.</p>

<p>“We were told it was the spirit of independence, a
spirit presumably fostered by the democratic teaching
of the board school which—if it had accomplished
nothing else—had effectually taught the children to
be <span class="lowcap">RUDE</span>. The pretty simplicity and deferential
mannerism described as characteristics of these villagers
by mid-Victorian writers had become obsolete;
courtseying was now regarded as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infra dig</i>: no one
touched their hats to or moved aside for ladies, and
the colloquial ‘sir’ and ‘mam’ had long since given
place to a familiar and condescending ‘Mr.’ or ‘Mrs.’
as the case might be.</p>

<p>“In Cornwall, we were informed, the manners of
the people are even worse, and if that is a fact, one
can hardly believe it possible, I am quite certain
we shall never cross the Tamar.</p>

<p>“Fortunately we had taken two of our favourite
servants with us, namely, Marie and Eugenie—the
latter my mother’s own maid, a capable person who
could turn her hand to anything, the former a
clever little cook we had imported from our own
country. But for this foresight on my part, I do not
know how my mother could have managed to exist.</p>

<p>“She is even more fastidious than I. She cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
bear anything coarse or uncouth—in comparison
a local servant would have made purgatory seem
pleasant.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will conclude we are rather
hard to please: perhaps we are somewhat exacting,
but we cannot help it; we are women of the old
school, may I add, of gentle birth, who claim to the
full all the privileges of our sex and station; besides
we offered a good sum for the house: we expected
to be treated fairly.</p>

<p>“According to the advertisement, ‘The Hall’ was
furnished: it was, in reality, nothing of the sort.
Can any house in which there is neither bookcase
nor bathroom be said to be furnished? Though
standing alone on a fairly large piece of ground—I
cannot truthfully say a garden—it might well have
been called semi-detached, for we searched in it in
vain to find a whole piece of furniture.</p>

<p>“Marie and Eugenie are smart young women:
they pride themselves on being slim and elegant.
Imagine then their disgust when the kitchen chairs
actually collapsed under them.</p>

<p>“I, too, had a grievance. Without conceit I may
say that it is not in my nature to be clumsy. How
was it then that I broke three cups, a saucer, and a
cream-jug within the short space of half an hour?
The reason was obvious enough! The cups were
all cracked, the saucers damaged, and the jugs should
have been labelled ‘beware of the handle.’ Even
moderately disfigured china is my mother’s pet
aversion. How she suffered under these circumstances
I will not attempt to describe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the plate! I have heard of gold plate,
silver plate, copper plate, brass plate, and electro
plate, but with none of these could I associate this
mongrel species, these odds and ends we were
called upon to use. It was, indeed, an enigma, and I
hate enigmas, especially when they are not worth
the trouble of solving. Luckily, substitutes were
easily obtainable. I wired for a complete supply of
plate from home, after which the motley crew of
hirelings were no longer in evidence.</p>

<p>“And the carpets! I have always thought such
luxuries, even the most costly, a doubtful blessing;
these were undoubtedly an unmixed evil. Fortunately,
we were able to dispense with them. The
floors underneath were of polished oak, and with
these we were greatly taken. True, we were somewhat
puzzled to account for certain irregularities in
the boards, but, on the whole, I think we should have
been more astonished had we found them intact.</p>

<p>“Could we, by any means, make the place tenantable?
Marie and Eugenie are brave and forgiving
girls! In spite of their recent adventure—they had
never been so insulted in their lives—they thought
it possible; mother and I were doubtful.</p>

<p>“We hired all the furniture there was to be hired
from the village, we engaged by the day the only
prepossessing and respectable woman it contained,
and we tried to settle down and pretend we enjoyed
it. From the beginning it was a fiasco—we were
miserable! and to add to our distress, or rather, to
fill to overflowing our cup of misfortune, the
weather became miserable, too; it began to rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was there to hope for now? Nothing!
What was there to do now? Nothing! Nothing
but sit at the window and gaze at the dreary lawn,
shut off from the road by a hideous wall, or to flit
about from room to room wringing one’s hands like
a distracted phantom.</p>

<p>“A phantom! I did not believe in phantoms when
I came to Thurlow; I treated the Unknown with
the blind levity of a Voltaire; I was inconsequently
sceptical; I had been born psychic.</p>

<p>“Though I was sublimely unconscious of it, the
dawn of my awakening was at hand.</p>

<p>“Though the house was undesirable in so many
ways—cold, bare, comfortless, dilapidated—it was
not without interest. It was old—old with the
antiquity of two or more centuries—and age is
always interesting.</p>

<p>“There were rooms in it, narrow, rectangular
rooms darkened by Virginian creeper that dropped
their crimson foliage over diamond panes, rooms
the very air of which seemed charged with the
shades of old-world wits and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i>.</p>

<p>“In my imagination the house had once been a
school: the severity of the walls, the coldness of
their neat yellow stones suggested it; I even went
so far as to fancy I could discern ink-stains on the
skirting-boards; and who but schoolboys ever
desecrate a floor with ink-stains?</p>

<p>“The predominating feature in the house was undoubtedly
the staircase.</p>

<p>“It was the first thing one noticed on entering;
there was no escaping it. Confronting the door in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the very middle of the hall, it stood there like some
grey and massive sentinel—and barred the way.
One wondered how it had ever got there, it was so
disproportionately large for the house. It was
masterful, aggressive, <span class="lowcap">FASCINATING</span> (Marie declared
‘there was no getting away from it—that it <span class="lowcap">LIVED</span>’)—and—it
was made of <span class="lowcap">STONE</span>. There was no doubt
about it now ‘The Hall’ had indeed been a school;
would any one but a pedagogue have a stone staircase?
Eugh! my mother felt a twinge of rheumatism
the moment she set eyes on it.</p>

<p>“It was curiously wanting in proportion; consisting
of barely a dozen steps, it was most uncomfortably
steep and of a most unnecessary width. I
compared it with some strange, squatting animal—a
comparison that grew on me the longer I remained
in the house.</p>

<p>“At the top of the staircase was a gallery, protected
by high rails, which I discovered connected
the used and disused portions of the house. In the
latter there were some rooms we did not care to
inhabit; there were a few we were even unable to
explore—they were locked.</p>

<p>“I felt no curiosity about them; they were certain
to be both commonplace, prosaic and dusty: every
time I passed them I smelt dust—and I cannot
endure a particle of dust. If I had believed any of
them to be a library, I might have been tempted to
pick the lock; I am passionately fond of books—that
is to say, of some books—when I am exiled in
the country and it is always raining.</p>

<p>“I was in search of a book which I had laid down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
somewhere, when I crossed the hall one afternoon,
and left my mother dozing in a big armchair before
the drawing-room fire.</p>

<p>“Marie said she had seen it on the oak settle; most
likely, for I often took my book and lounged on it.
You see I had grown fond of the oak settle
naturally, for it was the only piece of furniture in
that monster house that stirred in me any friendly
feeling whatever. But Marie must have been
dreaming, it was certainly not there. I would have
called to Marie to come and help me search for it, had
I not remembered that she and Eugenie had gone
into the village to do a little shopping on their own
account. They laugh in their grandest manner at
those ‘silly little shops,’ but with a true woman’s
instinct they cannot resist ‘buying.’</p>

<p>“I felt indignant, provoked, angry! never had I
wanted to read so much and never had I been at
such a loss to find a book.</p>

<p>“Oh! I recollected there was one upstairs—an
ancient and musty edition of ‘Eugene Aram’—(proof
positive, this, that the place was once a
school; would any one save a schoolmaster read
‘Eugene Aram’)? I had seen it lying on the floor
of a disused cupboard—alone and forsaken: a
solitary relic of the Academical bookshelf.</p>

<p>“Were I in a library, ‘Eugene Aram’ would
probably be the last book I would choose to read;
Lytton’s tales are horrible; I abominate horrors.
I thought of the staircase, I glanced at it; it was
really very dark. I shuddered!</p>

<p>“I did not understand why I shuddered, unless it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
was on account of a draught! Of course, a draught.
The house was full of draughts. The hour was late,
the afternoon was cold, it was March, and undoubtedly
a door was open somewhere; the book
was not worth the trouble, I was over-tired, I would
return to my mother. This I was actually preparing
to do when the sudden appearance of a light made
me pause—it came from the disused wing overhead.</p>

<p>“I can assure you I wanted very much to go to my
mother; I would have given all I possessed to have
gone to my mother; I could not: I could not stir;
that light enthralled me.</p>

<p>“I had never seen such a light—such a queer, unaccountable
light—a light that to anyone less sceptical
might have seemed an ‘<span class="lowcap">UNNATURAL</span>’ Light! Perhaps
it was an unnatural light—and I laughed. But
what—what in the name of Heaven could it be?</p>

<p>“Drawing rapidly nearer and quickly assuming
the appearance and proportions of a <span class="lowcap">FIRE</span>, it filled
me with the most unusual, the most preposterously
unusual, doubts and fears.</p>

<p>“And now for the first time I detected it was accompanied
by incongruous though perfectly intelligible
sound—the sound of someone tapping with
all their might, tapping with a pair of high-heeled
shoes.</p>

<p>“Aghast at this discovery, my perplexities increased,
and I was vainly endeavouring to extricate myself
from a chaotic quagmire of unpleasant thoughts,
when a scream, the very intensity of which made me
tremble, echoed and re-echoed throughout the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Fire! Fire! Bring me Fire!’ These words,
apparently so strangely paradoxical, were repeated
with renewed vigour and anguish, the voice after
each effort dying away into the most appalling and
piteous wail.</p>

<p>“The screams were coming nearer, but before I
had time to realise the tumult was so close at hand, or
to fortify myself against the tableau I now had every
reason to anticipate, a girl, her hair and dress a mass of
lurid flames, came rushing frantically into the gallery.</p>

<p>“The spectacle she presented was so satanically
awful that I immediately crossed myself. An indescribable
thrill of terror ran through me. I felt—I
<span class="lowcap">KNEW</span>—I was actually in the presence of an apparition;
nothing ‘earthly’ could possibly have produced
a similar or in any way equivalent effect.</p>

<p>“Staring at me through the yellow inferno of
flames was a woman’s face that, despite its horribly
contorted features, was amazingly and uniquely
beautiful, the perfect regularity of the Jewish lineaments
being strikingly enhanced by the whiteness of
the teeth, the blueness of the eyes.</p>

<p>“The latter came upon me as a further shock.
Though very lovely both in their excessive length
and hue, they did not match that style of face; to
have done so they should have been black or brown—and
their expression was repellent.</p>

<p>“I say repellent; I might with great accuracy say
‘hellish,’ for I saw in them the mirror of a sinful
soul—of a <span class="lowcap">VERY</span> sinful soul.</p>

<p>“I could form no idea as to her dress, the blaze
effectually hid everything save her face; but from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the partial glimpse I caught of a pair of satin shoes,
I surmised she was in some sort of ball-room
costume. The duration of her transit, though to me
an eternity, could not, I fancy, have occupied more
than a very few seconds.</p>

<p>“Still gazing at me and beating the air with
its hands, the phantom rushed shrieking onwards,
disappearing with the impetus of a tornado in the
inhabited portion of the house.</p>

<p>“I had no further ‘use’ for ‘Eugene Aram.’ I
returned to my mother.</p>

<p>“The same phenomena was witnessed by Marie
and Eugenie respectively within the next three days—on
the fourth we left. Had we remained, there
might have been a fatality; we were all genuinely
frightened—and mother is an invalid—a very nervous
invalid.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you feel inclined to say it was all a
matter of nerves. What more likely! We were an
isolated quartet of over-imaginative women! Or
you might say that some story we had heard in
connection with the house suggested these occult
demonstrations.</p>

<p>“Do not be premature! We only heard a few
weeks ago that ‘The Hall’ had a reputation for
being haunted, and it is now several months since
we left Thurlow. Our informant, a former tenant,
was, we have every reason to believe, a person of
indisputable veracity and common sense, in short, a
person quite incapable of inventing any such story
as the following which he kindly narrated for our
satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“It appears from what he told us (his MS. is still
in my bureau) that Thurlow Hall once belonged to
Mrs. Purvis, an old lady with one child, Charles.</p>

<p>“Charles was, of course, the apple of her eye;
Charles ruled the house; every one must obey Mr.
Charles; Mr. Charles could do nothing wrong.
Nothing wrong until, in the heyday of his youth, in
the season of wild oats, he unexpectedly fell in
love with a Gaiety girl—Phyllis (no one remembered
her other name)—and married her—and <span class="lowcap">THAT</span> was
very wrong.</p>

<p>“His mother was indignant—<span class="lowcap">FURIOUS</span>—not with
Charles, of course—but with that creature—Phyllis.</p>

<p>“Phyllis had inveigled him into marrying her;
Phyllis would bring eternal disgrace on the family;
Phyllis would run away with another man and ruin
him.</p>

<p>“Ruin <span class="lowcap">HIM</span>—ruin Charles—and the fond mother
grew despondent, very despondent, so despondent
indeed that unkind neighbours said she was mad.
They were wrong; the despondency was only a reaction,
she suddenly cheered up, all was apparently
forgiven and forgotten. Charles and Phyllis were
invited to spend Christmas at Thurlow.</p>

<p>“They went, very naturally they went—Charles
overjoyed at the prospect of displaying the Purvis
estate to his charming wife.</p>

<p>“His mother welcomed Phyllis effusively; she
made her feel thoroughly at home; she expressed
an ardent desire to see her in her bridal robes.</p>

<p>“Phyllis consented—what else could she do? She
had been a Gaiety girl! she had lived for admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Arrayed in her wedding garments she entered
Mrs. Purvis’s room, surprising the old lady in the
act of lighting an oil lamp—a rather ‘shaky’ old
lamp filled to the brim with oil.</p>

<p>“Phyllis was radiant; her sole thought was of the
sensation she would create at the coming Christmas
festivities. Had she been less absorbed she might
have noticed how the hand trembled that raised the
lamp; she might even have been on her guard.</p>

<p>“But vanity as well as love is blind. Phyllis
accepted Mrs. Purvis’s profuse expressions of
admiration and delight in good faith; they were, of
course, both genuine and natural; they were, moreover,
her due. The bride was intent on examining
herself in the mirror; her mother-in-law approached
her from behind, and, bending suddenly forward,
deliberately hurled the lamp on to the train of her
dress. There was a loud crash—an explosion—and
the wedding dress was on fire.</p>

<p>“No one was at hand to render assistance, Charles
and the servants having been slyly inveigled out of
the house, and the only response to her screams
were loud peals of laughter from her now wholly
insane mother-in-law.</p>

<p>“It was small wonder that the poor girl lost her
head, and, craving water, cried in her agony, ‘Bring
me fire, oh! bring me fire!’</p>

<p>“In that mad rush from the room along the disused
corridors her one endeavour would appear to have
been to reach her bedroom—perhaps she had forgotten
that Charles had gone <span class="lowcap">OUT</span>—but her efforts
were frustrated by the fiendish fury of the flames.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The amount of oil on her dress must have made it
blaze like a furnace.</p>

<p>“She had barely crossed the gallery into the
opposite wing of the house before her scorched
and smouldering limbs gave way, and falling to the
ground she was speedily burned to ashes; her
supreme and final agony being summed up in a
despairing cry, so loud and piercing that it was even
heard outside by Charles.</p>

<p>“Not daring to approach the house alone, Charles
summoned some villagers, and keeping well in their
rear, gingerly accompanied them across the lawn to
the front entrance.</p>

<p>“There they were met by Mrs. Purvis, chuckling
horribly.</p>

<p>“Corridors, gallery and staircase were in flames,
and had it not been for the opportune arrival of the
vicar the whole place would have been consumed;
thanks, however, to his vigour and level-headedness
the fire was eventually extinguished, and although
the damage done was considerable, the bulk of the
property remained unscathed.</p>

<p>“No trace of the unfortunate Mrs. Charles Purvis
being found, the precise manner of her death for
many years remained a mystery. But the erratic
babblings of her mother-in-law supplied material
for certain conjectures, which were afterwards confirmed
by the lucid and exhaustive confession of
the old lady, who regained her reason on her deathbed.</p>

<p>“Though a thorough restoration of the property
was effected, Charles would never live at the Hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
A long series of unsatisfactory tenancies succeeded
the events I have just related, and the story of a
ghost has at length come to stay.</p>

<p>“N.B.—I have good reason for believing the house
is still (August 1908) haunted; most probably this
will always be the case.”</p>

</div>


<h4>PREFACE</h4>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> publication from which the following extracts
are taken was printed at Northampton (where the
original may still be seen, August 1908) in the year
1764.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that the author, who was officiating
there as temporary chaplain to the jail, was a man
of indisputable and well-known integrity, and a
very popular preacher throughout the county.</p>

<p>In order to render his work useful and instructive,
innumerable references are made to the Scriptures,
but his quotations are of too great a length
for the following abridged tract, which is copied
from the original and contains only the account of
the interview the author had with Croxford’s
Ghost.</p>


<h4>THE GHOST</h4>

<p>It appears from the account given in a pamphlet
reprinted and sold by G. Henson, Letterpress and
Copper-plate Printer, Bridge Street, Northampton,
1848, that on Saturday, August 4, 1764, John Croxford,
together with three others of the names of
Seamark, Deacon and Butlin were tried at the
Assizes of Northampton and convicted of murder.</p>

<p>It came out at the trial that the unfortunate
victim was a native of Scotland, travelling with
goods, and that by chance he called at the house of
Seamark, a shepherd’s hut in the parish of Guilsborough,
Northamptonshire, where Croxford and his
companions used to meet, where they robbed and
afterwards cruelly murdered him, and in order to
prevent a discovery consumed his body in an oven;
which was proved on the evidence of one of Seamark’s
children, who was an eye-witness to the
transaction, by looking through the crevices of the
floor from the room above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>They were all found guilty and executed on
August 4, 1764, and Croxford’s body hung in chains
on Hollowell Heath, in the parish of Guilsborough,
near the spot where the horrid deed was perpetrated—(and
no spot more suggestive of such a
tragedy could be imagined).</p>

<p>The author of the work—at that time (1764) holding
the appointment of chaplain to the Northampton
Jail—after quoting passages from various writers
to prove the reality of the subject, proceeds to give
an account of the appearance of Croxford’s Ghost,
as follows:</p>

<p>“I shall now proceed without further lett or
impediment to a plain and conscientious account
of the ghost or apparition which was the occasion
of my troubling the world with this narrative;
unless I first observe that the behaviour of the
prisoners, one of whom is the subject of these
pages, lately tried, condemned and executed at
Northampton, for the murder of a person unknown,
upon the evidence of Ann Seamark and her son,
about nine or ten years old, was such as astonished
every beholder....</p>

<p>“Clear and conclusive as the evidence was
against them, no arguments, even after condemnation,
though delivered and enforced with the
utmost energy, precision and perspicuity by a learned
and worthy divine, were able to reach their hardened
hearts and prevail for an open and unreserved
confession of their guilt. Even at the gallows, in
their last addresses to the people, they insisted on
their innocence in the strongest terms imaginable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wishing the heaviest penalties an offended God
could inflict might be their portion in the next
world, if they were guilty of the murder that was
laid to their charge and for which they were about
to suffer.</p>

<p>“Thus did they divide the sentiments of the crowd
that many were brought over to a full persuasion of
their innocence, while others were left halting
between two opinions and severely agitated with
conflicting doubts. But mark the event.</p>

<p>“After having instructed my people as a teacher
in the knowledge of the Scriptures, I used to spend
the superfluous hours of the Lord’s Day in perusing
some part or other of the Old and New Testament.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, on August 12, 1764, being the
Sabbath, I returned as usual into my study, the
door of which is secured by a lock with a spring-bolt,
and sat down to my accustomed evening
devotion; the business of this day by rotation laying
in the New Testament, and in that part of it
where St. Paul in his Epistle to the Corinthians
proposes, maintains and proves the resurrection of
the body. Struck with the sublimity of his thoughts,
boldness of his figures, and energy of his diction,
and convinced by the number and weight of his
arguments, and looking with a pleasing foretaste of
happiness into futurity, I was on a sudden surprised
with the perfect form and appearance of a man, who
stood erect at a small distance from my right side.</p>

<p>“Conscious that the door was locked and that
there was no other means by which my visitor
could have entered, I was considerably surprised—surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
turning into abject terror—when, glancing
with irresistible fascination at the man, I perceived
in him something indefinably but most unmistakably
Unnatural.</p>

<p>“Feeling sure that I was in the actual presence
of an apparition, I contrived, by an almost superhuman
effort, I admit, to sum up sufficient courage
to speak—my voice seeming dry and unrecognisable.</p>

<p>“I addressed it in the power and spirit of the
Gospel; inquiring on what errand it was sent; what
was intended by such an application, and what
services could be expected from a person of so little
note and mean abilities as myself.</p>

<p>“I must here state that although the spectre had
inspired me with so much awe, I did not associate
it with anything <span class="lowcap">EVIL</span>.</p>

<p>“Every second tended to strengthen my composure,
and when it spoke in a voice rather more hollow
and intense, perhaps, than that of a human being,
my fears were instantly dissipated. I was now able
to take a close stock of it, and observed that in
features, general appearance, and clothes it closely
resembled any ordinary labouring man; it was in
expression and colouring, only it differed—its eyes
were lurid, its cheeks livid.</p>

<p>“Raising one extremely white and emaciated
hand, it desired me to compose myself, saying that
as it was now strictly limited by a Superior Power,
and could do no one act but by the permission of
God, I had no reason to be afraid, abrupt as was its
appearance, and that if I would endeavour to overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the visible perturbation I was in, it would
proceed in the business of its errand.</p>

<p>“At this announcement my heart fluttered with
an excitement I found difficult to control. Was
the wonderful mystery that had hitherto enshrouded
the existence and composition of the Unknown
about to be revealed to me—was I going to be
initiated into those secrets heretofore denied to
man? Eagerly promising to compose myself, and
lost to all else save the fascinating presence of my
guest, I settled down to listen to anything the
phantasm might have to say.</p>

<p>“The room, I must here state, was lighted by a
single, though rather powerful, double-wick oil
lamp, which I had always deemed sufficient to
illuminate the whole apartment, but which now—and
I could not help noticing the phenomenon—did
not extend its rays beyond the cadaverous face of
my intruder, upon which the full force of its light
seemed concentrated.</p>

<p>“Commencing in clear and solemn tones, the
phantasm stated that it was one of the unhappy
prisoners executed at Northampton on the 4th of
August, 1764.</p>

<p>“A cold chill ran down my back at this announcement,
which was intensified when I recognised for
the first time that the figure confronting me bore a
startling likeness to one of the prisoners it had been
my unhappy lot to address prior to his execution:
there was the same hair, brows and beard—black
and stubby; the protruding forehead and retreating
chin that had so repelled me, the malshaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
head and the broken, unsavoury-looking
teeth; it was indeed the ghost of one of those
diabolical miscreants that stood before me, and,
despite the fact that I was brought up in the strict
Protestant faith, I inadvertently crossed myself.</p>

<p>“The spectre went on without apparently heeding
my action.</p>

<p>“‘It had been,’ so it proclaimed, ‘the principal
and ringleader of the gang, most of whom it had
corrupted, debauched and seduced to that deplorable
method of life, and it was particularly appointed by
Providence to undeceive the world and remove
those doubts which the solemn protestations of
their innocence to the very hour of death had
raised in the minds of all who heard them.’</p>

<p>“At this juncture, excitement overcoming fear and
aversion, I hazarded to inquire of the phantasm its
name.</p>

<p>“Its reply, delivered in the same slow, measured,
almost mechanical tones (as if it were only the
mouth-organ of some other and unseen agency)
was to the effect that its name was John Croxford;
that it had express directions to come to me—directions
it could not disobey; it furthermore explained
the reason the murderers had so persistently insisted on
their innocence, lay in the fact, that, while the blood
of their victim was still warm, they entered into a
sacramental obligation, which they sealed by dipping
their fingers in the blood of the deceased and licking
the same, by which they bound themselves under
the penalty of eternal damnation never to betray the
fact themselves nor to confess, if condemned to die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
for it on the evidence of others, and that they were
further encouraged to such measures, since, as Seamark
himself was a confederate in the murder, they
concluded the evidence of his wife would not be
admitted; that as the child was so young, they
presumed no judge or jury would pay the least
regard to his depositions; that as Butlin had but
lately entered into a confederacy with them, and no
robberies could be readily proved against him, they
thought it would appear impossible for one of his
age to begin a career of wickedness with murder
(it being observed in a proverb that no man is
abandoned all at once); that if they could invalidate
the evidence on behalf of Butlin it must be of equal
advantage to them all; that though disappointed of
this view in court and condemned to die upon the
above evidence, they were still infatuated with the
same notion even at the gallows, and expected a
reprieve for Butlin when the halter was about his
neck, and consequently, if such a reprieve had been
granted, as the evidence was as full and decisive
against Butlin as against them, the sentence for the
murder must have been withdrawn from all, their
execution deferred, and perhaps transportation only
their final punishment.”</p>

<p>Though listening to every word with abnormal
attention, I became at the same time aware of a
strange and uncanny feeling that the identity of the
phantasm was but partly revealed to me in the
corpse-like figure opposite; what its true and entire
nature might be I dared not even hazard a conjecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>In the pause that followed its last speech, more to
hear myself speak than anything else (I could not
endure the silence of <span class="lowcap">THIS THING</span>), I asked if the
evidence of the woman and child was clear, punctual
and particular; to which it replied, “It was as circumstantial,
distinct and methodical as possible;
varying not in the least from truth in any one particular
of consequence, unless in the omission of
their horrid sacrament which she might possibly
neither observe nor know.”</p>

<p>I then asked why they had behaved with such
impropriety, impudence and clamour upon their
trial; to which it replied, “that they had been
somewhat elevated with liquor, privately conveyed
to them, and that by effrontery and a seemingly
undaunted behaviour they hoped to intimidate the
<span class="lowcap">WOMAN</span>, throw her into confusion, perplex her
depositions, thereby rendering the evidence precarious
and inconclusive, or at least give the court
some favourable presumptions of their innocence.”</p>

<p>I next inquired whether they knew the name of
the person murdered, whence he came, and what
reasons they had for committing so horrid a
barbarity.</p>

<p>To which the phantasm answered, “that the man
was a perfect stranger to them all, that the murder
was committed more out of wantonness and the
force of long-contracted habits of wickedness than
necessity, as they were at that time in no want of
money; that they first found occasion to quarrel
with the pedlar through a strange propensity to
mischief for which it could not account but from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
God’s withdrawing His grace, and leaving them to
all the extravagance and irregularities of a corrupted
heart, long hardened in the ways of sin; that the
man, being stout and undaunted, resented their ill-usage,
and in his own defence proceeded to blows;
that two only—Deacon and Croxford—were at first
concerned, but finding him resolute, they had called
up Seamark and Butlin, who were at a distance
behind the hedge; that they then all seized the
pedlar, notwithstanding which he struggled with
great violence to the very last against their united
efforts; nor did they think it safe to trifle any longer
with a man who gave such proofs of uncommon
strength; that with much difficulty they dragged
him down to Seamark’s yard and there committed
the murder as represented in court.”</p>

<p>I next asked if there was any licence in his bags
or pockets, that they might discover his name or
place of abode.</p>

<p>It replied, “No! that the paper left behind in its
(Croxford’s) writing was of a piece with the rest of
their conduct in this affair, a hardened untruth,
abounding with reflections as false, as scandalous
and wicked, suggested by the Father of Lies, who
had gradually brought them from one step of
iniquity to another, beginning first in the violation
of morality, to the place of purgatory in which they
now were.”</p>

<p>It further declared (a statement that interested me
greatly), “That though their bodies were unaffected
with pain, their souls were in darkness, under all
the dreadful apprehensions of remaining there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
eternity, far beyond what the liveliest imagination
while influenced by the weight and grossness of
matter, can conceive; that their doom had been not
a little aggravated by their final impenitence, impiety
and profaneness in adjuring God by the most horrid
imprecations to attest the truth of a palpable and
notorious falsehood, and by wishing that their own
portion in Eternity might be determined in consequence
thereof. Language,” the apparition said,
“was too weak to describe and mortality incapable
of conceiving a ten-thousandth part of their anguish
and despair even at present, and happy would it be
for succeeding ages if Posterity could be induced to
profit by their misfortunes and be influenced by
this account to avoid the punishment of the Earthbound.”</p>

<p>All this the phantasm delivered with such increased
distinction and perspicuity, with such an
emphasis and tone of voice, as plainly evinced the
truth of what it spoke and claimed my closest attention
and regard; and as it seemed to hint that I was
singled out to acquaint the world with these particulars
I told it that the present age was one of
incredulity and agnosticism, that few gave credit to
fables of this kind, that the world would conclude
me either a madman or impostor or brand me with
the odious imputations of superstition and enthusiasm,
that, therefore, true credentials would be
necessary, not only to preserve my own character,
but also to procure respect and credit to my relations.</p>

<p>To this the phantasm instantly responded that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
what I observed was perfectly right and requisite to
authenticate the truth of this affair, and that unless
some proper attestations were given to accounts of
this nature, they would be considered by the rational
part of mankind as mere tales, invented only to
amuse the credulous or frighten children on a
winter’s evening into temper and obedience; in
short, that they would have no weight, and disappoint
the ends of Providence, who intends them for the
good and benefit of the world; that, therefore, in
order to encourage my perseverance in supporting
the truth of this appearance and embolden me to
publish a minute detail of it, it would direct me to
such a criterion as would put the reality of it beyond
all dispute; and it accordingly told me that in such
a spot, describing it as minutely as possible, in the
parish of Guilsborough, was deposited a gold ring
which belonged to the pedlar whom they murdered,
and moreover in the inside was engraved this
singular motto:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>HANGED HE’LL BE WHO STEALS ME, <span class="f8">1745</span></p>
</div>

<p>“That on perusing it,” the apparition continued,
“it (Croxford) had been smitten with grave apprehensions,
and, thinking the words ominous, had
buried the ring, hoping thus to elude the sentence
denounced at random against the unlawful possessor
of it, and even escape the vindictive justice of
Heaven itself by such a precaution; that if I found
not every particular in regard to this ring exactly as
it related it to me, then I might conclude there was
not a single syllable of truth in the whole, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
no obligation lay upon me to take any
further concerns in the affair.”</p>

<p>Engaged in this interesting and all-absorbing
conversation, I suddenly became aware it was very
late—the silence throughout the house for the first
time appalled me, and I was about to make a movement
towards the door to make sure all was safe
without, when the light from the lamp once again
became normal. With a startled glance I looked
for the phantasm—it was gone; nor was there any
other means by which it could have taken its departure
save by dematerialisation.</p>

<p>Bitterly disappointed, my fears being now entirely
removed, at so abrupt a disappearance, I sat down
very calmly, and in the coolest manner canvassed
over the whole matter to myself, reflected seriously on
every particular, and was induced to conclude from
the coherence and punctuality of the account that
it was impossible it should be fiction or imposture.
I laid particular stress upon the circumstance
of the ring, the singularity of its motto, and
the minute description of the spot where it was
deposited.</p>

<p>I considered, moreover, from the tests I had made
by shutting my eyes and pressing the balls with my
forefinger, that I had been perfectly awake, had had
the full use both of my senses and reason, and was
as capable of knowing the figure and voice of a man
as the size and print of the book I was reading at the
time the ghost made its appearance.</p>

<p>In short, firmly persuaded of the truth of what I
had heard and seen, I resolved on the morrow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
search for the ring, and thereby clear it up beyond
all possibility of doubt.</p>

<p>Accordingly on Monday morning early, between
four and five o’clock, I set out alone, making directly
to the spot the phantasm had described; found the
ring without the least difficulty or delay; examined
the motto and date of it, which corresponded exactly
with his account of it, and fully convinced me of my
obligation to communicate to the world the particulars
of the whole.</p>

<p>With this resolution, immediately on my return I
sat down and drew up the whole conversation as
near as I could recollect, neither omitting nor adding
any circumstance of consequence in the manner you
now see it, and trusting it will prove of use to the
public for whose benefit it seems intended.</p>

<p>The original manuscript, to which the author
appends his name, concludes with a very fervid
exhortation to piety, coupled with an equally strong
warning against indulgence in vice and crime.</p>

<p>The story of the ghost, judging by the interest
that is even now (1908) taken in it, must have created
a considerable sensation at the time—so much so
that I think a brief history of the crime—gruesome
though it be—will bear repeating.</p>

<p>Prior to doing so, however, I should like to relate
a ghostly experience that happened to me, Elliott
O’Donnell, in the same neighbourhood, August 1904.</p>

<p>The village of Guilsborough is on an eminence
10 miles N.W. by N. of Northampton, 4 miles from
the source of the Avon at Naseby, 10 miles N.E.
from Daventry, 11 miles from Lutterworth, 10 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
S.S.W. from Market Harboro’, 12 miles E. from
Rugby, and 76 miles from London.</p>

<p>The adjacent country, consisting of large stretches
of smiling meadows, dales, and table-lands, is very
fair for the eye to dwell upon, and it is only at night,
when the shadows from the many spinneys are cast
upon the gleaming roads and silent tarns, or when
the wind, rustling through the elms and oaks, sound
like the breaking and falling of surf on the seashore—it
is only then that the place presents an entirely
different aspect to the psychic mind and one conjures
up—<span class="lowcap">GHOSTS</span>.</p>

<p>During the period of my early visits to Guilsborough,
the history of the village was unknown to
me, nor did I for one moment associate it with
superphysical manifestations till I was staying at the
hamlet of Creaton, some three miles distant, and had
to tramp home late at night.</p>

<p>I must confess, then, that I was unquestionably
glad to leave the crossroads at the top of Crow Hill
and the lonely turnpike behind and find myself
snugly ensconced within the very material precincts
of the Cricketers’ Arms.</p>

<p>The route I took, led me past the long-disused
burial-ground of some Nonconformist Fraternity, a
spot one never seemed to notice by day, but which
struck me as singularly eerie at night.</p>

<p>On this particular night in question, I did not
leave my friend’s house in Guilsborough till close on
twelve, an hour when all village folk are in bed and
the place is wrapped in the most profound silence.
The sound of my footsteps, as I briskly pounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
down the road, echoed and re-echoed through the
village. I welcomed the sound; it was nice to have
even that for a companion. I am not as a rule
nervous, I have been too much by myself in life to
be an abject coward, yet I must confess I never
anticipated the walk from Guilsborough along the
lonely turnpike-road after nightfall without an
uncomfortable itching in my back.</p>

<p>I was just beginning to get that sensation when I
arrived at the rusty gates of the cemetery, and was
confounded beyond measure on seeing a curious,
grotesque sort of creature climb over the iron bars
and confront me. The moonlight was so powerful
that it left nothing uncovered or concealed.</p>

<p>A frightful terror laid hold of me—what—what in
the <span class="lowcap">NAME OF HEAVEN</span> could it be?</p>

<p>Gazing at it with a fascination as hideous as the
thing itself, I took in every feature—the long, loose
limbs, the thin body, the huge hands and feet, the
little repulsive head, the white fulsome, pig-like face,
and the protruding, sapphire eyes.</p>

<p>For some seconds—to me an eternity—we watched
one another in breathless silence—the Elemental
(for as such I at length recognised it) being the first
to take the initiative. The unfathomable stare in its
eyes gradually deepened into a horrible and very
unmistakable expression of malignant joy in which
all the most undesirable of human vices seemed
blended: its monstrous hands rose like wings on
either side of its head, the fingers twitching convulsively
in greedy anticipation of clutching me; its legs
slowly crouched as if about to spring—and then—just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
as the crucial moment arrived and the acme of my
terrors was reached—the spell was broken—the
leaden weights fell from off my feet—my limbs
became endowed with a thousandfold their natural
elasticity—and—turning round—I fled.</p>

<p>So ended my first and only experience with a
Guilsborough ghost. I have taken very good care
since then to give that burial-ground a very wide
berth after nightfall. But now comes the most
extraordinary part of it. I had heard off-and-on that
a certain house in the village (since pulled down) was
supposed to be haunted; that one bedroom in particular
had struck those occupying it as containing an
invisible “presence” both inimical and horrible.</p>

<p>I never, however, associated this mysterious something
with the Elemental I had seen, till, in the
course of a conversation with an old and highly
respected inhabitant of the village a few days since
(August 10, 1908), I learned that he had had a
psychical adventure of a somewhat extraordinary
nature in his boyhood.</p>

<p>Upon pressing him, he told me that he had lived
in the haunted house as a child, and on running
upstairs to his bedroom one morning had seen a
long, thin human form with a tiny head and animal’s
face crouching on the bed and staring at him.
Terrified out of his wits by this unexpected and
startling spectacle, he had remained glued to the
spot for some seconds, until a slight movement on
the part of the Elemental broke the spell, and he
was able to “bolt” precipitately from the apartment:
this was the only time he saw it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Here then surely was the key to the nature of the
haunting—an Elemental or Poltergeist, assuredly the
same that had appeared to me some fifty years later
at the gate of the old burial-ground.</p>

<p>My informant, by the way, had not heard of my
experience; I had told it to no one: hence this visual
occult manifestation of mine in Guilsborough stands
corroborated.</p>

<p>But why this haunting? Why this form of
apparition?</p>

<p>I dived into the history of Guilsborough, and
discovered that quantities of fossils (trilobites, &amp;c.),
together with implements of flint—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, arrow-heads,
javelins, celts (the latter popularly known as
“thunderbolts”) have been and are still found in
various parts of the village and in the gravel-pits
of the adjoining hamlets of Nortorft and Hollowell;
that tumuli yet remain in Guilsborough
Park and in several of the neighbouring fields,
and that numbers of very ancient bones have been
from time to time dug out of the soil in all parts
of the village.</p>

<p>All this is conclusive evidence that Guilsborough
is far older than its average inhabitant of to-day
imagines, that it has been alternately the site of
Palaeolithic and Neolithic settlements, and that all
sorts of barbaric rites and ceremonies have been
conducted on the very ground where houses and
cottages now stand.</p>

<p>Hence it is not very surprising to any one at all
versed in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> of Phantasms and
Psychic Phenomena to hear that one of the apparitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
(at least) haunting Guilsborough appears in the
form of a sub-human or sub-animal elemental.</p>

<p>Superphysical manifestations of this kind—let me
explain for the benefit of the inexperienced—usually
occur on the sites of or near ancient and unconsecrated
or long-disused burial-places—the whys and
the wherefores of which I hope to dwell upon in
detail in a subsequent volume.</p>


<h3>PART II</h3>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>I now append the account of the Croxford Trial
copied (with as few alterations as possible) from
the pamphlet reprinted by Mr. Henson of
Northampton in 1848</p>
</div>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">At</span> the Assizes held at Northampton on Thursday,
August 2, 1764, came on before the Right Honourable
the Lord Chief Baron Varker the trials of
Benjamin Deacon, John Croxford, and Richard
Butlin for the murder of a travelling pedlar—known
only as Scottie—at a house of ill-fame called
“Catslo”—in the Parish of Guilsborough, kept
by one Thomas Seamark (who was executed at
Northampton on April 23 last for a robbery on the
highway) and had been a receptacle of thieves and
highwaymen for some time.</p>

<p>The chief evidence against them was that of
Anne Seamark, widow of the above Thomas
Seamark. She deposed that sometime between
Michaelmas and Christmas last the said pedlar
(supposed to be one Thomas Corey) came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
said house where were at that time the said
Seamark, Deacon, Croxford, and Butlin to whom
he offered stockings, &amp;c., for sale, but not agreeing
as to the price, they proposed to murder him and
directly Seamark knocked him down, Butlin fell
upon his legs, Deacon upon his face to prevent him
crying out and Croxford, pulling out a knife, cut
his throat in such a manner that the head was
almost off, but the body stirring a little, Croxford
stabbed him in the head which put an end to his
life.</p>

<p>They then stripped him and carried the clothes
upstairs where Seamark’s three children were in
bed; after which a hole was dug by Seamark in the
close adjoining to the house where they buried the
body; but thinking themselves not safe, they dug
up the body again and cut it into several pieces.</p>

<p>These latter they put into an oven and were three
days and nights trying to consume them; in the
end succeeding only with the flesh and having to
bury the bones which were now produced in court
and held as testimony against them.</p>

<p>Being asked by the judge why she did not reveal
the same before, Mrs. Seamark answered that her
husband threatened to murder her if she mentioned
it to anyone, whilst Croxford holding a knife to her
throat with one hand and having a book in the
other, swore he would instantly kill her if she did
not take an oath to conceal all knowledge of the
matter.</p>

<p>The next witness for the prosecution, Mrs.
Seamark’s little boy of ten years of age, stated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on being kicked one day at school by a playmate,
he had in a passion cried out that he would serve
him as his daddy served “Scottie,” which statement
being overheard by the schoolmaster, the latter
called him into his presence and demanded an
explanation.</p>

<p>On the witness refusing to comply, he was shut
in a room by himself where he remained till the
arrival of his mother.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Schoolmaster, who like
everyone else in Guilsborough, had only known the
Pedlar by the name of “Scottie,” and like other
folk had wondered at his long absence from the
village, seeing that many people owed him money
and others were in want of goods, began to put two
and two together and had arrived at the conclusion
that the boy knew more than he dare tell, when
Mrs. Seamark entered the house in a state of breathless
alarm to know why her son had not “turned
up” for his dinner. Whereupon the Schoolmaster
had boldly taxed her with a knowledge of Scottie’s
fate which after no little hesitation and a great
many tears she had admitted.</p>

<p>This had led to the present witness confessing,
that chancing to peep through the cracks of the
chamber floor one afternoon, he had seen his father
and some other men trying to burn some hands
and feet in an oven, near to which were a light grey
coat and a cane which he recognised as belonging
to “Scottie” who had been to their house the day
before. On being asked by the Judge if he could
identify the prisoners with the men he had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
helping his father, he at once answered in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>This concluded his testimony after which several
other witnesses (whose evidence I cannot record
here through lack of space) were then called;
Croxford, Deacon and Butlin protesting their innocence
of the crime laid against them, declaring that
the whole case had been maliciously trumped up by
Mrs. Seamark and her son.</p>

<p>After the evidence on both sides had been
thoroughly examined, the judge summed up, and
the jury after a quarter of an hour’s absence returned
with a verdict of wilful murder; a demonstration
being made by the prisoners against Ann
Seamark as she left the Court.</p>

<p>On Saturday August 4th, the prisoners were carried
from the jail to the place of execution, guarded by
a party of Sir Charles Howard’s Dragoons with
fixed bayonets and muskets loaded with powder
and ball, where they joined fervently in the prayers
with the minister, Croxford delivering a paper to
one of the attendant gaolers, which he desired might
be published for the satisfaction of the world. This
document is too long to quote <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad verbum</i>; a brief
summary will suffice. In it John Croxford says that
he is about twenty-three years of age and by trade
a tailor, that he was born at Brixworth of creditable
parents who gave him a liberal education, and that his
character and behaviour were very good until about
January 1760, when he got into bad company, which
had proved his ruin—this much he confessed, but
denied that he had been guilty of murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Benjamin Deacon writes that he was born at
Spratton, is about twenty-five years of age, and by
trade a sawyer; that he bore a tolerably good
character until about Christmas last, when he committed
various crimes, but not murder.</p>

<p>Richard Butlin testifies that he was born of respectable
parents at Guilsborough, had a good education,
is about twenty years of age, and by trade a
glover and breeches maker, that he has always borne
a good character and is innocent of murder.</p>

<p>The manuscript goes on to say that they—the
said John Croxford, Benj. Deacon and Richard
Butlin—were to die the next day, being condemned
on the false oath of Ann Seamark, the vilest wretch
that ever appeared in a Court of Justice, and that
there was not one word of truth in her evidence
and that of her boy, it being a hellish and malicious
contrivance of their’s to take away their lives, that
Croxford was never with Butlin until Guilsborough
Feast, which was about the 25th of October, and
never was in the Close with Butlin and Deacon but
once, and that about the 15th of November, and
never in the house with them; and that in their
opinion no murder had been committed.</p>

<p>That they did not doubt but the whole affair
would be brought to light, though too late to be of
any service to them; and that they hoped Ann
Seamark would be rewarded according to her
deserts, that they would die in peace with her and
with all the world, bearing her no malice, only
hoping the great God would make known their
innocence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The document winds up with these words: “Done
in Northampton Gaol, the night before the execution,
as a caution to all good people. We, the poor
unhappy sufferers, do severally set our hands to
this, it being nothing but Truth,</p>

<div class="sgn">
<p>
“John Croxford.<br />
“Benj. Deacon.<br />
“Richard Butlin.”
</p>
</div>

<p class="cl">At the place of execution they behaved with great
fortitude, still denying their knowledge of the
murder, but confessing themselves guilty of many
irregularities. They gave much attention to the
Divine Service, and departed, advising all the spectators
to beware of keeping bad company and declaring
that they died in peace with the world.</p>

<p>After their execution the body of Croxford was
carried to Hollowell Heath, in the parish of Guilsborough,
where it was hanged in chains on a gibbet
erected for that purpose, the bodies of Deacon and
Butlin being delivered to a surgeon to be dissected.</p>

<p>This concludes the history of the Guilsborough
murder, posterity concurring with the verdict of
the jury and agreeing that there were sensible and
useful grounds for the appearance of the Phantasm
of the perjured Croxford to the Chaplain of the
Northampton Jail.</p>

<span class="stl">THE DREADFUL SMELL</span></h2>

<p>Technical form of apparitions: Phantasms of the dead</p>

<p>Source of authenticity: Copies almost <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad verbum</i>
from the MS. lent me by Mrs. Browne, February
1908.</p>

<p>Cause of haunting: Vice and Premature Burial</p>
</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">My</span> name is Elizabeth Rita Browne; I am a native
of Birmingham and my husband, John Alexander
is the rector of a small parish near Wolverhampton.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1900 my husband, who had
long been ailing, never having properly recovered
from an attack of typhoid, was obliged to take a
holiday, engaging a locum to do his work.</p>

<p>Like the majority of clergymen, his stipend was
not very large and we could not, consequently,
afford to go to any expensive place. An advertisement
in a well-known fashion gazette attracting our
attention, we at once made inquiries, with the result
that Wolsey Abbey became ours for three months
at a practically nominal rent.</p>

<p>Of course it was in an extremely out-of-the-way
spot; there was no railway within six miles and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
neighbourhood was dull, flat and uninteresting; still
we might have marvelled at getting it so absurdly
cheap, had we not heard that money was of no
object to the owner, who was a semi-millionaire.</p>

<p>We arrived early one evening in July; the sun
was yet visible in the sky and its dying efforts would
have enhanced the meanest rural beauty.</p>

<p>I cannot say we were comfortably impressed with
the building; it was of course simply colossal
compared with our own little home, but so grim
and grey, so forlorn and forbidding, and withal so
inhospitable, that a momentary fear seized me lest
its leaden hued and crumbling walls should prove
our winding-sheets.</p>

<p>The grounds, overgrown with every imaginable
kind of weed that here attained Brobdingnagian
dimensions, gently shelved down to the house,
which lay in a minute valley, dank, damp and
dismal; the funereal aspect being further augmented
by clumps of giant pines and elms, the shadows
from which were already beginning to wave
phantastically on both walls and gables.</p>

<p>To our right, almost hidden by the thick foliage
of the trees and luxuriant herbage, we espied the
twinkling surface of a sheet of water which we
subsequently learned was a tarn or lake of almost
unfathomable depth and darkness.</p>

<p>The principal feature of the mansion seemed to
be that of antiquity, of excessive antiquity, more
particularly the Gothic monastic dome which, resting
on Norman columns, formed the termination of the
left wing, the right and central portion of the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
dating back I believe to Henry VIIth’s reign—though
of this I have no positive proof.</p>

<p>The lapse of ages had wrought much discolouration,
added to which was the disfigurement caused
by lichens and minute fungi that, spreading over the
whole exterior, hung in a fine tangled web-work
from the eaves. But apart from this there were no
very great dilapidations, the masonry remaining
intact, whilst the woodwork, save for a few deep
rents and indentures, seemed to be in an extraordinarily
good state of repair.</p>

<p>The hand of nature had apparently been peremptorily
and mysteriously arrested in its work of
dissolution and decay.</p>

<p>The inside of the house, though not belying the
mournful expectations we had formed from the
exterior, drew from us all exclamations of wonder
and admiration—never had we seen such magnificent
oak panelling, nor such exquisitely carved
ceilings, nor such vast stretches of tapestry (worn
and faded though it was), whilst the ebon blackness
of the floors, and the size and massiveness of the
furniture, were what we had hitherto only associated
with the grandeur of a palace or castle.</p>

<p>My daughters Mary and Eunice were charmed
and impressed, and both my husband and I felt our
misgivings rapidly diminish when a few minutes
later we were enjoying a dainty and well-cooked
supper in one of the large and stately reception
rooms.</p>

<p>The first days of our sojourn there passed with
the pleasant monotony of well-earned rest; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
rambled through the long and straggling and seemingly
interminable corridors of the house, and about
the grounds and gardens, finding much to marvel
at, much to envy.</p>

<p>In the day time the sun struggling feebly through
the trellised panes of glass filled the rooms and
passages with a crimson glow—a glow both warming
and enriching, but at various times and in certain
places startlingly and horribly suggestive of blood;
the analogy struck me the more forcibly each day I
observed it, so much so that I grew afraid to ascend
the staircases—<span class="lowcap">ALONE</span>.</p>

<p>Mary and Eunice laughed at my misgivings; to
them the house and surroundings were the quintessence
of mediæval splendour and romance; they
revelled in the grandeur of the interior trappings, in
the freedom of the vast park and gardens; it was
only after the third week that they, too, suddenly
grew <span class="lowcap">AFRAID</span>.</p>

<p>But whereas my fears had been prompted by a
comparison, a comparison which, however near and
repellent, still remained a <span class="lowcap">COMPARISON</span>, theirs were
generated by something which, although scarcely
more tangible, was unmistakably <span class="lowcap">REAL</span>.</p>

<p>They were constantly assailed by a <span class="lowcap">SMELL</span>—a cold,
icy cold, pungent, beastly smell, that would on some
occasions approach them along a corridor or staircase,
and at others steal surreptitiously behind them
from some obscure nook or cranny.</p>

<p>It was foul, pestilential, inexplicable; they had
never smelt anything like it before; it was nothing
recognisable; it neither emanated from drainage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
nor from dead animals behind the skirting-boards;
it was nauseous, suffocating, freezing—and—as if it
lived—it <span class="lowcap">MOVED</span>.</p>

<p>From the moment they first became aware of its
presence, their pleasure in the house ceased; all
their time was now spent in the garden, but in that
part of the garden only whence no view of the
tarn could be obtained and where there were no
trees.</p>

<p>Neither my husband nor I had encountered the
Smell, but it was not very long before the servants
did—and—one by one they <span class="lowcap">LEFT</span>, nor could we find
any that were willing to take their place, the Abbey
bearing a very evil reputation in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The question of our daughters’ health began to
cause us some anxiety; were we doing right in
remaining in the house and exposing them to the
danger of some serious malady? for although the
origin of the Smell was a mystery, the effect of so
horrible a stench could not prove otherwise than
injurious.</p>

<p>We decided, therefore, to give up our tenancy at
the expiration of another week, the idea of quitting
such palatial quarters and retiring to the meanness
of some petty villa or four-room cottage not disturbing
us half so much as our inability to arrive
at the cause of that Smell.</p>

<p>In the silence of the night, when no other sounds
were to be heard, save the gentle beating of the
branches against our window and the occasional
hooting of an owl, we lay awake and wondered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
wondered why it never came to us, but always to
Mary and Eunice.</p>

<p>The house, I have said, was liberally furnished;
both rooms and passages were covered with soft if
somewhat faded carpets; there was no lack of
tables, couches, chairs, &amp;c., whilst the walls were
adorned with pictures which, though darkened by
dust and blistered by the sun, revealed the art of old
and well-known masters; but it was the library that
attracted and pleased us most.</p>

<p>There arranged methodically in the ample bookcases
were volumes of every description; books
of ancient lore, <i class="magazine">Spectators</i>, <i class="magazine">Tatlers</i>, Richardson’s
“Pamela,” Defoe’s “Moll of Flanders,” Tyndale’s
Bible, Dryden’s and Gifford’s Translations from the
Classics, the Mysticisms of Swedenborg, Behmen
and Plotinus and countless others, many, even of
greater rarity and value, bound uniformly in those
covers of rich Moroccan leather so characteristic of
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>One among all others had riveted our attention
from the very first. I have already alluded to the
peculiar and ghastly phenomenon produced by the
sun’s rays penetrating the coloured glass in the
corridors and on the staircases; here it was even
more pronounced though only very locally, the full
force of the rays being focussed in the most startling
manner on the metal clasp of a volume of stupendous
size and apparently vast antiquity; the result being
that whereas the entire book was bathed in a bloody
halo, the others were left in a comparatively clear
and normal light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Appalled yet fascinated by this unaccountable
anomaly, we had several times attempted to remove
the volume in order to pry into its contents but we
were unable to do so, owing, we imagined, to its
having stuck or being fastened in some peculiar
manner to the shelf—and we were afraid to use any
great force for fear of damaging the cover; consequently
our curiosity had to remain unsatisfied.</p>

<p>The night, however, preceding our departure from
the Abbey (August 11) my husband had already
left by a mid-day train, I was whiling away the few
remaining hours in the study—Mary and Eunice
being as I thought, engaged in packing—when—suddenly—I
heard some one approach the door as
if on tiptoe. The next moment there came a loud
knock and the sonorous sound of the grandfather
clock in the alcove beside me commencing to strike
seven, the two noises were almost simultaneous.</p>

<p>Wondering who my visitor could be—our only
servant, a woman from the nearest village, having
left an hour ago—I smoothed my gown and walking
hastily to the door threw it open.</p>

<p>As I did so a current of cold air, tainted with the
most disgusting and detestable stench conceivable,
sent me half staggering, half choking backwards,
and I perceived standing on the threshold, not ten
paces from me two figures of hellish horror.
Featureless, fleshless, foul, clad in the tattered,
rotted garments of a monk and nun, they confronted
me motionless, silent, and then the voice of my
Eunice attracting their attention, they slowly wheeled
round and glided ghoulishly along the passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>I gave one shriek of warning to Eunice as she
hove in sight, carrying in her arms a tray of odds
and ends for me to sort.</p>

<p>For a second or so she stood too petrified to
move—and—then—as the <span class="lowcap">THINGS</span> appeared on the
verge of touching her with their long, outstretched
arms, she dropped the tray and, uttering a kind of
terrified gasp, fled precipitately.</p>

<p>They did not pursue her, but gliding onward
with the same mechanical movements, suddenly
vanished on reaching the wall at the end of the
corridor; nor did we, I am thankful to say see them
again.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowcap">SMELL</span> had explained itself.</p>

<p>Anxious to get to Eunice and fearsome lest she
should have fainted, I was about to quit the study,
when my eyes were attracted to an object on the
floor. It was the mysterious volume which, loosened
from the shelf in some miraculous fashion, had
fallen to the ground, and now lay open, its ponderous,
gilded clasps undone and limp.</p>

<p>The fading sunlight concentrating its rays on the
pages of the book in a final and prodigiously bloody
effort, enabled me to read the following extract:
“and for this great and unpardonable sin of the
Abbess Hilda and the Monk Nicholas, we—the
Saintly and Beloved Abbot Matthew, the learned
Franciscan brother Raymond, the laymen and
labourers, Barber and Brooks together with I, Sir
John Hickson Leigh, Knight did entomb them
alive, clasped in each other’s arms, cursing man and
blaspheming heaven, on the eve of the 11th day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
August, 1521. And of the exact spot in the Abbey
of Wolsey wherein they be buried, no man—save we
who placed them there—knoweth, nor shall any
discover the same until the day cometh when the
secrets of all flesh shall be revealed.”</p>

<p>This much I read and no more for the light
proving too strong for me, I was compelled to
remove my gaze and when I opened my eyes and
saw again the volume it had gone, and lo! to my
intense and unfeigned amazement it was back again
in its customary place on the shelf, nor could the
united efforts of myself and daughters remove it
from that spot.</p>

<p>Regarding this extraordinary incident, as the only
feasible explanation of the phenomena Eunice and
I had seen, we could arrive at no other conclusion
than that the house (once Wolsey Abbey) was
haunted by the phantasms of the Abbess Hilda and
the Monk Nicholas; and with such an explanation
we have had to be content.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the most annoying things in this world few
are more so than missing one’s train, especially
when it happens to be the last in the day.</p>

<p>This unpleasant experience happened to me one
evening early in September 1895. I came into
Euston just as the 7 <span class="lowcap">P.M.</span> for Northampton—the
last train connected with Brixworth—was steaming
out of the station—and so, willy-nilly, I had to
remain in town all night.</p>

<p>“Where to put up,” now became the absorbing
question. I wanted to be close to the station in
order to catch the earliest morning train, but,
although there were plenty of rich men’s hotels,
there seemed a sore dearth of “go-betweens;” it
was either five shillings the night or sixpence; Purgatory
or Hell: I could see no place that suited <span class="lowcap">ME</span>.</p>

<p>At last after traversing many squares and the
more respectable of the side streets, I retraced my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
steps, eventually alighting on a private and inconsequential
looking hotel in Euston Road.</p>

<p>The interior of the establishment was in keeping
with the exterior—gloomy and forbidding, and the
damp, earthy smell that seemed to rise from the
basement made me gravely apprehensive of rheumatism;
still the tariff was in strict accordance
with my means, and feeling too tired to wander
further, I decided to remain.</p>

<p>The room in which I had a very sparse supper
was like the majority of dining-rooms in middle-class
hotels: overcrowded with unwieldy furniture,
frowsy, ill-ventilated; imagine that the table had
been laid once and for all (it had undoubtedly
presented the same spectacle for months), and that
the cloth, never very white, was removed, only,
when it grew too begrimed even for the blunted
susceptibilities of the proprietress. I afterwards
found that the beef did not belie its looks, that the
bread was in excellent accord, and that the water
might well have been the receptacle of innumerable
generations of bacilli.</p>

<p>There were other visitors besides myself, either
Germans or commercial travellers, probably both;
but as their conversation carried on over plates of
half raw meat, was neither particularly edifying nor
interesting, I preferred an antique number of
<i class="magazine">Vanity Fair</i> until, at length, tiring of that, I picked
up a candlestick and made my way to bed.</p>

<p>The moment I crossed the threshold of my room,
that peculiar and indefinable sensation that invariably
suggests the immediate proximity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
superphysical came over me, I felt sure the house
was haunted. But by what? Ah! that was the
problem left for <span class="lowcap">ME</span> to solve.</p>

<p>The furniture of the room was of the orthodox
lodging-house type—inartistic, scant and seedy; a
gaunt four-poster propped against the middle of
the wall running at right angles to the door was
adorned with exceedingly dirty valances of a nondescript
pink and white pattern; facing this was
a fireplace the register of which was of course
down; to the left of this was a hanging wardrobe
that I at once examined and found to contain
nothing more formidable than a score or two of
black-beetles that scuttled unceremoniously away
into holes at the sight of my candle; whilst on the
opposite side of the room, facing the window, was
a rickety dressing-table surmounted by a still more
rickety looking-glass. In one corner of the room
stood a washing-stand from which the white paint
had peeled in a hundred places, and in the other
corner a dismantled bureau that resembled some
vessel after a great storm. These, I believe, apart
from a couple of cane-bottomed chairs, constituted
the entire furniture, nor can I say this scantiness,
taking into consideration the poorness of the
quality, was any matter of regret.</p>

<p>The carpet, undoubtedly the best feature of the
room, and either an Axminster or a Brussels—not
being an expert on such a point I cannot tell
which—hid all the boarding save where the margins
were stained with a preparation of potash.</p>

<p>I give all these details to show that several years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of practical investigation of haunted houses had
developed my inquiring faculties to a very high
degree, little, if anything, escaping my notice.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i> of ghosts often lies where it is
least expected; in some article of furniture, not
infrequently a cupboard near at hand, in the panelling,
the skirting, or, not infrequently again, on or
under the boards.</p>

<p>When I am in a haunted room, my first instinct,
therefore, is to take a very careful stock of my surroundings;
the bare appearance or touch of a piece of
furniture often supplying me with the necessary clue.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, nothing arousing my
suspicions and feeling abnormally sleepy, I bolted
my door and lay on the bed; I say “on,” not “in,”
as a cursory glance at the pillow made me draw
deductions as to the sheets. Within a few minutes
I went to sleep, falling into a heavy, dreamless
slumber from which I was suddenly and most
alarmingly awakened by the feeling I was no longer
alone in the room.</p>

<p>Opening my eyes, I perceived the apartment
flooded with a bright unnatural light that apparently
emanated from, or at all events accompanied,
the figure of a little old woman with yellow
hair and a heliotrope skirt. I noticed these idiosyncrasies
of person and dress directly, the nature
of the light accentuating them, and my senses being,
as they always are in the presence of superphysical
phenomena, wonderfully and painfully acute.</p>

<p>Standing in front of the dressing-table, the
eccentric individual was examining herself with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
greatest curiosity in the crazy looking-glass to which
allusion has already been made.</p>

<p>Her profile was angular, her lack of colour ghastly,
whilst from her ears hung that style of drop-earring
worn by ladies in the days of the crinoline; otherwise
her costume might have belonged to the latter
seventies or early eighties. There was nothing
actually <span class="lowcap">HORRIBLE</span> about her, save her reflection,
and as my eyes turned with irresistible fascination
towards the looking-glass, my blood turned to ice.
The surface of the mirror, made preternaturally
bright, flashed back the most hideous, the most
incomparably <span class="lowcap">HIDEOUS</span> image of Fear.</p>

<p>Never! never in all my life had I seen depicted
in aught but Wiertz’s pictures such inconceivably
awful terror as that which confronted me there—and
now as I gazed at it, a sickly curiosity seized me
as to what could be the origin of such Hellish Fear.
Was it Fear of Death; of the Unknown metetherical
Abysses; of Eternal Damnation; of what?</p>

<p>Then—as I followed the direction of the dilating
pupils—I saw—God help me—the Cause! Descending
from a few inches above her head were the
snake-like coils of a rope. Had I been able to turn
my head, maybe I should have seen whence they
came; but I could not move a muscle, and could
only feel the keynote to some great and hitherto
unsolvable mystery was at hand but purposely hidden
from me.</p>

<p>There was scant time for speculation. The enactment
of this drama was brief as it was lurid;
uttering an appalling scream that was quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
converted into a gurgle of the most blood-curdling
significance, the old lady clawed the air with her
spidery fingers.</p>

<p>The murderer was pitiless, the noose coming to
with an irresistible snap, jerked the wretched victim
off her feet.</p>

<p>For one instant—the most harrowing of all—I
watched her falling backwards; watched the changing
of her deadly pallor into a deep and vivid purple,
watched the rolling of her starting eyeballs, the
foam-flakes on her lips, and the frenzied movements
of her stiffening arms and then—<span class="lowcap">THEN</span>—as she
struck the ground with a reverberating crash—all
was darkness. The ghostly tragedy for this night
at least was over.</p>

<p>This I realised, but my nerves being too completely
unstrung by what I had witnessed to allow
me to sleep, I crept under the counterpane and lay
there shivering till the welcome rays of early dawn
converted the room into another place. My first
movement was to examine the scene of the ghostly
murder, and upon turning up the carpet, I discovered
not a bloodstain, but a comparatively new piece of
boarding!</p>

<p>With that, drawing my own conclusions, I had
to rest content—there was nothing else in the room
that could in any way have been transmuted into
evidence.</p>

<p>The moment the clock struck six I picked up my
valise, and gobbling down a lukewarm breakfast
with little relish, quitted the house, determining to
pay it another visit before very long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>In this, however, I was doomed to disappointment.
Some months elapsed before I could again
visit the neighbourhood of Euston, and when I did
so, I found the hotel had vanished nor have I to
this day been able to identify the house wherein I
slept.</p>

<p>I have but lately been informed that a good many
years ago (when we middle-aged fogies were mere
children) a singularly repulsive murder was committed
at a house in or near Euston Road, the
victim being a somewhat extraordinary old lady.
Further details I do not know, therefore I can only
surmise that what I saw may possibly have been
<span class="lowcap">HER</span> phantasm—but please remember, it is <span class="lowcap">ONLY</span> a
surmise.</p>

<span class="stl">THE BLACK PEDLAR</span></h2>

<p>Technical form of apparition: Phantasm of the dead</p>

<p>Source of authenticity: “Ladies’ Cabinet,” 1835,
and elsewhere</p>

<p>Cause of haunting: Murder</p>
</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> “Ladies Cabinet” for 1835 contains an account
of a haunting in Merioneth that seems to me of
sufficient psychic interest to record.</p>

<p>Hence I append it; but since the original text is
a trifle too intricate in places, I have taken the liberty
to tell the story more or less in my own words:</p>

<p>“In the summer of 1832 I was on a walking tour
in Wales; in selecting, as the principal scene of my
operations, Merioneth, and chancing one evening
to be overtaken by a storm, when midway between
Dolgelly and Bala, I was speedily placed in the most
unpleasant of predicaments. To go on I was afraid,
to turn back was impossible; what could I do?
The night was dark, the rain almost tropical, and
the roadway so broken up with furrows that I could
only grope along with the utmost difficulty; whilst
the frequent windings, steep ascents, and sharp declivities
not only added to my embarrassment, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
greatly increased my weariness. At every few
yards I either plunged into a miniature morass or,
stumbling over a boulder, found myself smarting in
the centre of a gorse bush.</p>

<p>“At length I grew desperate—human nature could
stand it no longer—and resolving to perish with the
cold rather than flounder on under such pitiable
conditions, I threw myself down on a rock and prepared
to lie there till daybreak.</p>

<p>“It is possible I had remained in this position for
ten or so minutes, when I was roused to a sense of
deliverance by the bright glow of a lamp, and starting
up to my feet, I discovered I was no longer
alone. Confronting me was the figure of a short
man, wrapped in a shaggy great-coat, and wearing
a slouched hat. He was holding a lantern in his
hand. By a series of pantomimic gestures he assured
me that his intentions were amicable, and that he
was anxious to guide me to some place of shelter
where I should have a more comfortable pallet than
a bare rock.</p>

<p>“I accepted his offer, though not without some
misgivings, as I could not remember ever having
met with any one quite so uncouth or bizarre.</p>

<p>“Turning abruptly to the right he struck across a
wide moor covered with gorse and innumerable
boulders, and so studded with pools of water that I
seemed to be in a perpetual state of wading. Emerging
from this, we wended our way along the side of
a precipice, at the bottom of which roared one of
those mountain torrents so characteristic of all parts
of Wales.</p>

<p>“Beckoning to me to follow, my guide mysteriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
disappeared, and peering over the edge of
the chasm, I perceived him, to my amazement,
making his descent by an almost invisible and perpendicular
pathway. For a second or so I hesitated,
and then, making up my mind to brave anything
rather than remain by myself in such an unfamiliar
and dangerous neighbourhood, I gingerly lowered
myself over the brink, and, after a few tumbles,
succeeded in overtaking him just as he arrived at the
bottom.</p>

<p>“We now found ourselves in a valley of stygian
darkness, and of such restricted dimensions that the
spray from the river bathed me from head to foot.
My companion pressed resolutely on, and, maintaining
the same extraordinary and uncanny silence,
conducted me to a recess in the hillside where the
outlines of a bare, dismantled house gradually arose
to greet us. It was merely a pile of ruins, old, yet
naked, without any of those evidences of vegetation
one usually associates with the antique. I particularly
noticed this deficiency; it impressed and perplexed
me. If moss and lichens grew elsewhere—why
not here?</p>

<p>“The situation of the house was strikingly romantic
and weird—indeed, one could not well imagine a
more dismal spot. A giant mass of black rock reared
itself in the background like a Brobdingnagian bat.
In the foreground, and at so close a distance that
the spray blowing madly over my face and clothes
drenched me to the skin, rushed a seething mass of
sable water, whilst to accentuate all this Avernian
horror, the wind whistled demoniacally, and the
rain fell with ever-increasing fury. Turning to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
guide, I impatiently requested him ‘to move on,’
and take me with the greatest expedition to the
nearest available hostelry.</p>

<p>“In reply he took off his hat, and, thrusting his monstrous
head forward, revealed to my horror-stricken
gaze a shapeless, sodden mass of black flesh!</p>

<p>“The cause of his silence was now obvious—he
couldn’t speak because he had no mouth; but
neither had he eyes, ears, or nose; nothing but that
awful, unmeaning, rotund protuberance.</p>

<p>“I stood aghast, too terrified to stir, almost too
terrified to breathe, with the hideous Thing looming
there before me, and the booming of the river
behind. It was a ghastly situation.</p>

<p>“The creature advanced an inch—my blood
turned to ice; it raised its arms—my soul sickened
within me; it lunged suddenly forward—and—fell
right through me. As it did so I heard a fiendish
chuckle, which, dying slowly out, gave way to a
succession of blood-curdling groans that seemed to
proceed from the interior of the ruins. The figure,
however, was nowhere to be seen; it must have
dematerialised on the spot.</p>

<p>“Very much relieved at this, though still considerably
frightened, I was now able to use my
limbs, and turning my back on the ghostly building,
I felt my way along the bank of the river. I dare
not glance at the boiling foam, the very sound of it
made my flesh creep; nor did I feel in any degree
safe till a winding of the footpath brought me to a
bridge, on the opposite side of which I saw the
twinkling lights of many houses. I was now, once
again, in the land of the living, and a substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
meal by a cosy fire helped, in a good measure, to
dissipate my fears and recompense me for all the
trials I had undergone.</p>

<p>“Prior to leaving the inn next day I learned from
my host that the hollow was known to be haunted,
and, on that account, was universally shunned after
sunset. Half a century ago the ruins—then a neat
grey cottage—had been inhabited by the Evanses, a
bad, thriftless ‘lot.’</p>

<p>“At the instigation of her husband, and with the
motive of robbery, Mrs. Evans, a buxom woman—handsome
in a bad bold style—had flirted openly
with a pedlar, known locally as ‘Black Dave.’</p>

<p>“This man was easily induced to put up at their
house, and his suspicions being lulled to rest by the
amorous overtures of the woman, he was surprised
in his sleep and butchered.</p>

<p>“Fearing, however, either to commit the body to
the river or bury it in their garden lest it should be
found, and being at the time very hard pressed for food—they
improvised an oven in the earth and ate it!</p>

<p>“The vengeance of Heaven was, however, close
on their track; the cottage, paid for out of their
ill-gotten gains, caught fire during a drunken
carousal, and Mrs. Evans was burned to death,
whilst her husband only lingered long enough to
make a full confession of the crime.</p>

<p>“The house was never rebuilt; the phantasm of
Dave, in the disgusting guise in which he appeared
to me, still haunts the precincts, and, delighting to
gull unsuspecting wayfarers, leads them out of their
proper courses, guiding them with a fiendish skill
to the black ruin—the scene of his ghastly murder.”</p>

<h3>THE STORY</h3>

<p>My invitation to spend the Christmas holidays with
Lady Wentworth came as a delightful surprise.</p>

<p>Imagine me a poor, insignificant little schoolmistress
in St. Rudolphs, suddenly blossoming out
into a much envied guest at Catchfield. Who can
blame me if I indulged in a momentary outburst of
pride?</p>

<p>So far my lot in life had not been all <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couleur de
rose</i>. Losing my husband shortly after our marriage,
I had been obliged to do something for a bare
living.</p>

<p>My education though fair had fallen short of
Girton or a degree, and I was barely qualified to
teach any but very small children. Had I but
foreseen the future, I might no doubt have done
better. As it was my position was only that of a
kindergarten schoolmistress in St. Rudolphs.</p>

<p>I do not think you can truly estimate a person’s
disposition till you see how they behave to those
who have the misfortune to be in subordinate
positions, nor can you always tell a shoddy lady
from a real one until you have discovered how she
treats her governess and servants. Until I taught
in St. Rudolphs I had no idea how thoroughly
common were the majority of its so-called aristocracy,
but one term was quite sufficient to show
me that dealing with such hopelessly and innately
vulgar people would be almost more than I could
bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>It was therefore scarcely a matter of wonder—that
when Christmas drew nigh—the Christmas after
my first sojourn in St. Rudolphs—I was almost
beside myself with joy on receiving a pressing invitation
to stay at Catchfield Hall. Nothing soothes
the sensitive nature of a snob more than to call
other people snobbish. The parents of my children
were of the middle class—middlish—snobs with a
very big S, and should any one need a proof of the
correctness of this assertion let me point to him the
fact that whenever a moneyed person came to reside
within any get-at-able distance whatever, the people
I have designated as “snobs” made all haste to call
on them; even the bishop whose object in coming
to St. Rudolphs was obviously only “to confirm,”
was inundated with invitations to dinner, and the
rival claims to eligibility of those invited to meet
him, were openly discussed at afternoon tea and
bridge parties. Let me also add that their club,
ludicrously labelled “select,” boycotted one of its
members for some trivial remark, true enough, but
like so many other homely truths better left unsaid,
and that these very people who had sat in judgment,
themselves indulged in the most scathingly rude
remarks to those who for certain reasons were
obliged to “grin and bear it.”</p>

<p>Therefore I repeat again, the parents of my children
were snobs, and being snobs would not allow
any one in the humble position of a schoolmistress
to say any thing that might in any way be construed
into snobbishness.</p>

<p>Depict to yourself then how indignant they were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and how I laughed up my sleeve when I let slip,
quite by mischance you understand, the fact that I
was going to spend Christmas with my near, my
very near kinsman Lord Robert Wentworth.</p>

<p>A schoolmistress related to a peer! How preposterous!
how absurd! how snobbish! and they
laughed at first scornfully, then incredulously—then
pityingly, and I—I humbly bowed them out of the
house, and running upstairs continued my packing.
Vale St. Rudolphs! Welcome Catchfield!</p>

<p>Under these circumstances you can imagine why
I tell you all this—it is to show you how more than
overjoyed I was at the thought of eating my
Christmas pudding among gentlefolk.</p>

<p>When I got out at Highfield—the nearest station
to Catchfield—my lord’s brougham stood in waiting.</p>

<p>“They are very full up at the Hall, madam,” the
coachman said, touching his hat respectfully, “otherwise
miladi would have sent one of the motors, but
they have both had to go out longish distances.”</p>

<p>“Is there a house-party?” I faltered, giving one
of the horses—I love horses—a gentle pat on the
head.</p>

<p>“What! didn’t you know? I beg your pardon,
madam,” the fellow added suddenly, recollecting
himself, “but it is the Coming of Age party of the
Hon. Walter early next week that has fetched well-nigh
half the county; you see he is the eldest son—and—well,
madam, there is to be a very big ball. I
made sure madam knew all about it.”</p>

<p>I shook my head despairingly, balls were not for
such as I. I had neither a dress nor yet the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
wherewith to buy one. Most decidedly I ought not
to have come! I glanced at the man to see if he
understood my misgivings, apparently he did not;
perhaps he would not; his manner at all events
was in no degree less deferential, and as he shut the
carriage door with the courtly air of an old gallant,
I compared him with the parents at St. Rudolphs—the
comparison of course being all in his favour.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe the exterior of
Catchfield, it has been done so often and so well in
historical romances, in biographies, and in County
Directories that any additional effort of mine would
be at once superfluous and poor.</p>

<p>I arrived there late—too late for dinner—and
partook of a dainty supper laid expressly for me in
the ball-room presumptive. Fancy supper by myself
in a ball-room! But there was apparently a doubt
as to which of the rooms would be used for the
occasion, his lordship being somewhat reluctant at
present to allow this handsomely, I might almost
say sombrely, furnished apartment to be used for
such a frivolous purpose.</p>

<p>Remembering Robert’s sanctimonious bringing
up I was not in the least surprised at his qualms,
my only wonder being that he countenanced a ball
at all, but of course that was miladi’s doings. I
much wished to inquire why a solitary meal for
such as I should be served in a room of such
splendid dimensions, and one that in most households
would undoubtedly have been used as a
drawing-room, but I refrained, not desiring to
appear inquisitive in the eyes of the servants. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
ladyship arrived as I was finishing my second cup
of fragrant coffee, and despite a certain languid
hauteur characteristic of the nobility, especially
of the <span class="lowcap">MODERN</span> nobility, she appeared to welcome
me.</p>

<p>I felt this, and yet somehow I was puzzled—puzzled
at an indescribable something in her manner
that was quite apart from pride—something that
left me with the decidedly unpleasant impression
she was surely acting a part, and—yet—why
should she? Why should her ladyship be anything
but frank with the poor and inoffensive cousin
of her husband?</p>

<p>But what was it that made her eyes fall as they
encountered mine, and wander furtively round the
room; and why that sudden look of fear that crept
into them as they alighted on the fireplace.</p>

<p>“You wont mind sitting here till bedtime, will
you?” she observed, “I will tell Webster, my maid,
to bring you your candle at eleven o’clock. If there
is anything you want, you have only to tell <span class="lowcap">HER</span>.
All our guests play bridge, and I concluded from
what Robert told me you didn’t approve of gambling,
so I thought you would be happier here. We
are expecting other anti-gamblers in a few days, so
your banishment will only be temporary! You will
excuse us for a time, wont you?”</p>

<p>What other reply could I give but “O yes! most
certainly! It is indeed kind of you to allow me the
use of such a lovely room, &amp;c.,” and Lady Wentworth
departed from my presence with a gracious—a most
patronising and highly gracious smile. I was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
course charmed and flattered, as any poor connection
by marriage should be, but I wished all the same
that Robert had also come to welcome me, I should
have felt more at ease with Robert! I liked Robert,
and—well, I did not like his beautiful and accomplished
wife. Had he come only for two minutes I
should not have minded, but I was tired, I felt
neglected, and I longed for kindness. Kindness
after St. Rudolphs. It was not like Robert, we had
been such friends in our youth; children together,
playmates, chums! Had money and position
changed his nature?</p>

<p>Money! I grew dispirited! I was poor! terribly
poor! I was lonely! Oh, so lonely!</p>

<p>The room was huge, the night cold and the fire
<span class="lowcap">SMALL</span>—very small.</p>

<p>Drawing my chair close to it I simulated ease; I
tried to feel cosy! Cosy!</p>

<p>What a barrier, an insurmountable barrier, was
poverty to pleasure! Would Robert’s wife have
banished a countess? Fancy a countess experiencing
a reception such as this! A countess in
a vast room empty save for draughts and a Liliputian
fire! A countess! I laughed! I was growing
common like the mediocre parents of St. Rudolphs.
Vulgarity is catching! It is both epidemic and
endemic.</p>

<p>Had Robert told her I disapproved of playing
cards for money? Of course not, that was a society
taradiddle! He couldn’t know my scruples or he
would never have asked me to meet his wife. She,
she had guessed my poverty by my profession—all
schoolmistresses are poor; every one that teaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
is poor—education must be gratis. A cold blast
of air from the chimney made me shiver. The
room was indeed draughty! and how still! I
did not altogether like such stillness, it got on
my nerves. And how dark! Why were not all
the gas jets lighted—why only this one? Because I
was poor; the poor should learn to be economical,
and example is better than precept! Hence this
feeble flicker: a flicker that failing to reach the
further extremities of the chamber, left the corners
enveloped in shrouds of darkness—of a black impenetrable
darkness I could neither fathom nor comprehend.
The furniture was superb, but it was of
too funereal a texture and colour to be pleasing to
me just then, I would have preferred something of
a brighter tone.</p>

<p>The floor was covered by a carpet that must
assuredly have been made expressly for that room
since it stretched right up to the skirting, concealing
every particle of bare board.</p>

<p>I could not see the pattern, I could only devise
by the soft tread of the carpet that it was either of
Persian or Turkish manufacture. In some places,
where kissed by the moonlight, it was almost white,
whilst in other parts it was rendered black by a hotch-potch
of countless shadows lying thick upon it.</p>

<p>Through the great bay windows opposite me, a
magnificent panorama of lawn, meadows and rivers,
beyond which I fancied I could detect the needle-like
front of a steeple, spread itself before my eyes.
All this natural beauty lay enhanced by a thin
covering of gleaming snow. It was Christmas!
The glamour of the hour and season enchanted me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
past injuries and St. Rudolphs were forgotten; I
was at peace with all men.</p>

<p>At peace! What wouldn’t I give if I could always
be so; if these broad acres, this noble mansion,
this stately apartment were mine—mine—<span class="lowcap">ALL MINE</span>—and
the stillness of the room again oppressed me.</p>

<p>Where were the many guests miladi had mentioned?
Where were the sounds of revelry? The
high-pitched voices of women, the hoarser tones of
men, the indistinct murmuring of conversation such
as I had sat and listened to in days of yore; how it
had hummed and buzzed around me when plunged
in pleasant reverie, it then had no more effect on
my hearing than the lapping of the gentlest waves
on the seashore. There were no such sounds now;
these massive walls were a sure, impenetrable barrier
to whatever might be going on outside—this room—far
from being filled with giddy babblers—was
empty, distractedly, painfully <span class="lowcap">EMPTY</span>, empty save
for the dancing moonbeams and the moving
shadows.</p>

<p>But was it empty? My heart gave a violent,
sickly throb as I recollected the look of disquietude,
of grave, of indisputably grave apprehension in
miladi’s eyes as she peered around! Of what had
she been afraid—of the approaching twilight, of
the shadows, of the gloom; and as I cast a terrified
glance ahead of me I fancied—foolish fancy! that
those palls of darkness I have already mentioned
had come out further from the nooks and crannies
and were fast approaching me.</p>

<p>Those of us who have ever ridden on horseback<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
by night across some dreary wilderness, or along a
lonely road have doubtless had occasion to observe
a strange alteration in the behaviour of our beast;
its psychic propensities have been suddenly and
mysteriously awakened; it fights shy of some particular
tree, or stone, or gap in the hedge; its ears
twitch, its flanks quiver, it is all on the tremble, the
slightest sound would now make it take the bit
between its teeth and bolt; it is afraid not necessarily
of what it has seen, but what it fears may be there!
And—to an anomalous species of terror I found
myself a bounden slave.</p>

<p>I dreaded to think of the effect even the most
trivial sound or incident might now produce on
my agitated mind. Had I been able, I would have
risked the displeasure of my hostess and left the
room, but I <span class="lowcap">COULD NOT</span>; every atom of strength
seemed to have quitted my body—I was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tempore</i>
cataleptic—<span class="lowcap">PARALYSED</span>.</p>

<p>A faint and almost imperceptible movement suddenly
attracted my attention to a square patch of
light on the carpet immediately before me.</p>

<p>To my horror something was coming <span class="lowcap">THROUGH</span>
the floor. Slowly, very slowly, first of all a head, a
head surmounted with long dishevelled black hair,
then a <span class="lowcap">FACE</span>! God save me from seeing the like
again—a face that might have once been beautiful,
or plain, or ugly, but was now—<span class="lowcap">NOTHING</span>—nothing—I
won’t describe—nothing but the <span class="lowcap">GRAVE</span>; then
shoulders, bust, what was once a body, legs. Held
in its arms in close embrace—was the figure of a
baby—in a like state of nudity and decay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment, only for a moment, they stood
swaying silently to and fro in the moonlight, and
then with a snakelike movement of her body the
phantom of the woman glided across the room,
vanishing in the recess containing the large bay
window.</p>

<p>After the subsidation of intense terror at this
hideous spectacle I had been compelled to witness,
the pulsating of my heart once again becoming
normal, I was able to reflect with comparative calmness
on what I had seen.</p>

<p>I say with comparative calmness, for a strong
suspicion now entered my mind that Lady Wentworth
may have anticipated all along what would
happen, and that I had been put in that room as a
mere experiment to see whether it were still haunted.
The bare idea of such perfidy filled me with so great
an indignation that I seriously thought of trumping
up some excuse and returning home; my resolutions
being shattered only by the opportune arrival of
Cousin Robert, whose cordial welcome acting like a
stimulant made me decide to remain.</p>

<p>With a thoughtfulness that had singled him out
from among his companions as a boy, he noticed my
weariness, and putting it down to the fatigue of my
journey went in search of his wife’s maid.</p>

<p>Need I say that I was thankful to get to bed and
there, despite my ghostly adventures, I slept very
soundly till the gong went for breakfast, at which
free and easy meal I made the acquaintance of some
very charming guests.</p>

<p>Miladi was of course too much in request to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
more than a few minutes with poor, insignificant me;
she expressed an earnest hope that I had not been
too dull for words and that I had found the room
warm and comfortable. “At all events,” she added,
“you can sit and read there without fear of interruption.
I know how fond of books you ‘clever’
people are—you must go into the library and choose
some. You were not disturbed last night were
you?”</p>

<p>Though this question was put in the most artless
manner possible and with all apparent ingenuousness
I detected a half frightened, half inquiring expression
in her eyes that she vainly tried to stifle, an
expression which converted the suspicion I had
entertained into a conviction, a conviction that this
woman was isolating me to serve some deep and
subtle purpose.</p>

<p>I tried to get out of the lady’s-maid what this
purpose might be, but if Webster knew she most
certainly showed no signs of it, being doubtless as
accomplished an actress as her mistress.</p>

<p>As one may readily conclude I looked forward to
the evening with little equanimity, offering up
fervent prayers for any incident that might add to
the duration of dinner.</p>

<p>Now I hate grand dinners as a rule; their regality
unnerves me; I am appalled at the number of
people; at the dazzling display of plate, at the
multiplicity of the courses (many of the dishes being
unknown to me), at the ceaseless flow of conversation,
at the clatter of glasses, at the wine, at everything;
but on this occasion I simply revelled in it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the greatest formalities appealed to me as pleasantly
distracting; I was poor, my companions wealthy
scions of the aristocracy. I had nothing to do but
eat—eat and be silent; be silent and listen; listen
and look, and I saw all that one would have wanted
to see in the atelier of the very best costumière in
Paris or the West End.</p>

<p>My own dress was shabby but what of that! No
one seemed aware of it, no one noticed me; I was a
nonentity, mute, a consuming machine; in no one’s
way because each of my neighbours was far too
engrossed in eating to care about carrying on a
conversation.</p>

<p>Once I thought a lady cast a half enviable glance
at my hands; they are my best point, particularly
so, when nicely manicured—and once I imagined,
dear Robert, but there, <span class="lowcap">THAT</span> was only imagination.</p>

<p>Well the dinner, like all good things, came to an
end at last. I enjoyed the dessert most; the bonbons
were heavenly; every one ate them as if they
were hungry; I caught myself actually pitying our
hostess. At a signal from miladi, we all got up; I
left the other ladies in the hall; they trooped away
to fetch their purses, whilst I, feeling very much
like some poor whipped schoolgirl, slunk off to
the ball-room.</p>

<p>It was not until the door closed behind me, I
understood the full horror of the situation; I was
alone! for the second time within twenty-four
hours—in that chamber—Alone! Alone save for
those foul pollutions that might rise at any instant
from beneath the floor. I believe, even then, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
have flown had not the stubbornness and pride innate
in all my family restrained me. Come what would,
her ladyship should never call me a coward.</p>

<p>So—I stuck to my post with heroic resolutions.
Much as I suffered the previous day, my sufferings
then in comparison with now were small, nor did
the dreadful anticipations that tortured me without
cessation as I sat there, waiting for the boards to
part asunder, in any way surpass the awful realisation.
Step by step, detail by detail the psychic
drama was repeated in all its damnable horror; my
recovery after witnessing it being slower on this
occasion, accompanied by relapses into a state of
terror too painful even to recall.</p>

<p>Yet I survived and succeeded in so far pulling
myself together, that I met the kindly greeting of her
ladyship at breakfast next morning with a calm and
unembarrassed air. She did not suspect me. Once
again the ordeal came and miladi, with a refinement
of cruelty worthy of her steel-blue eyes and thin
lips, herself conducted me to the fatal ball-room.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, you will have company,” she
murmured, her face shining white amid that semi-gloom,
“I must apologise for not giving you more
light, but—for some <span class="lowcap">UNEARTHLY</span> reason or other—only
one of those gas jets will ever burn. Odd is it
not?” And as her eyes met mine, I walked to the
fire and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>She was disarmed! Could any one laugh who
was afraid of ghosts?</p>

<p>She speedily, <span class="lowcap">VERY</span> speedily left me and once
again I underwent it <span class="lowcap">ALL</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Suspense—horror—prostration. I think I suffered
more this third night than on either of the other two.</p>

<p>Yet, long before morning I had recovered from
the shock.</p>

<p>I saw a look of genuine relief rush into her ladyship’s
face as she encountered my smiling countenance:
whatever apprehensions she might have had
with regard to <span class="lowcap">THAT</span> room were now unquestionably
removed.</p>

<p>“It must be cleared out without further delay!”
I heard her remark to Robert, “the floor will take
some time polishing—and—remember the incandescent
burners!”</p>

<p>The incandescent burners! I chuckled, what
effect would <span class="lowcap">THEY</span> have on <span class="lowcap">GHOSTS</span>. I half expected
she would now tell me why she had been anxious I
should remain in the room: she was assured it was
no longer haunted, why trouble about the past?</p>

<p>But a moment’s reflection made me think that
after all it might be “the past” she was most
anxious to conceal; hauntings, especially of so
gruesome a nature as this, usually point to some
blot on the escutcheon, to a disreputable something
in the history of the house—and that is why so
many people object to seeing their family ghosts
appear in print.</p>

<p>Accordingly, miladi, having the honour of the
Wentworths at heart, would take very good care
she did not give me as much as a hint as to what
she herself, quite possibly, attributed to legends.</p>

<p>Webster did indeed favour me with the information,
that neither her ladyship nor any one else, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Lord Wentworth and the old charwoman (who
dusted) were ever known to enter the room, at all
events since <span class="lowcap">SHE</span> had been at the Hall, and that was
well nigh ten years; which information clearly
implied that entrance was strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>It was interesting to speculate what course miladi
would have adopted, had I told her what I had seen!
She was proud, domineering and tactful; would
she have “pooh-poohed!” the whole thing; commanded
me to be silent; resorted to bribery, or
what? I couldn’t imagine her pleading—and yet—the
Honour of the Old Aristocracy is very dear to
them; they sometimes value it more than—life.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span></p>

<p>The next few days passed agreeably and all too
quickly for me. The non-card playing element,
though rather stiff and prudish, were kindly disposed
towards me, no doubt on account of my shy disposition
and impecunious widowhood.</p>

<p>Of Robert I saw very little; the host and hostess
in a big house never have a moment to spare. To
prepare the ball-room an extra staff of servants
was employed incessantly for three days, at the
end of which time it was pronounced ready for the
occasion.</p>

<p>I can find no words to convey to others the
singular way in which the altered room impressed
me. Though stripped of all its massive, gloomy
furniture, brilliantly illuminated with many jets of
incandescent gas (Robert had a strange aversion to
electricity) and adorned with festoons of Oriental
flowers, banners, and the gayest coloured bunting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
it still retained an air of sadness, and an indescribable
something, that nothing, nothing short of total
annihilation, could ever eradicate or modify.</p>

<p>Her ladyship clad in a snowy dress of the most
costly material trimmed with the rarest lace, her fair
arms and bosom glittering with the Wentworth
diamonds, looked like a fairy queen standing on the
threshold of an enchanted castle.</p>

<p>I looked closely at her but could see no remnant
of apprehension either in her eyes or gestures, she
was perfectly at ease and sublimely unconscious of
aught but the enjoyment of those around her and
the importance attached to herself, the well-dressed
handsome hostess.</p>

<p>With Robert it was otherwise; in spite of his
smiles, his bows, his many pretty actions of old-world
gallantry, I could see that the wan, grey spirit
of unrest stalking at his elbow never left him. He
would have staked his soul to glance occasionally
at the spot before the fireplace, but fear lest some
one might see him effectually held him back. This
continual mental struggle, unsuspected even by his
wife, was only too obviously apparent to me, and I
seemed to hear a sigh of relief—of deep and earnest
relief—issue from his lips when the orchestra
began.</p>

<p>And now all was symphony and movement.
There was much glare and glitter and piquancy;
snake-like evolutions, spasmodic convergences,
dexterous extrications, all performed and repeated
with mathematical precision and untiring repetition.</p>

<p>The music changed—the waltz gave place to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
novel and somewhat wildly executed fandango. It
was her ladyship’s whim to include in her programme
exotic dances; a resuscitation of long-forgotten
Terpsichore, they were undoubtedly the
distinguishing and characteristic features of her
entertainments, raising them far above the commonplace,
and gaining for miladi a world-wide and
much-coveted reputation. She hated anything
merely popular and vulgar.</p>

<p>In this dance that now commenced and which I
beheld for the first time, there was much of the
beautiful, the wanton, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bizarre</i>, and just a suspicion
of “something” which might have shocked
a very exacting “Grundy.”</p>

<p>As the greater number of the guests, like myself,
were unacquainted with it, the floor was left comparatively
free for the performers, the onlookers
lining the walls, the doorway, and the big bay
window.</p>

<p>Never had I witnessed such enthusiasm; the
dancers, throwing their very heart and soul into
their antics, gyrated and pirouetted in such lively
fashion as evoked spontaneous outbursts of applause
from the delighted, albeit bewildered and somewhat
puzzled spectators.</p>

<p>The faster the music, the quicker the feet, the
louder the clapping.</p>

<p>And now, at a moment when the revelry had
reached its height and the attention of all was
riveted on the dancers, a sudden commotion in
their midst made everybody wonder. What was it?
What had happened?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>I glanced at the clock, Robert glanced too; our
eyes met, and I read in his a deadly fear; it was
the hour for the dead to rise.</p>

<p>The space in front of the fireplace was now
deserted, and the dancers, grouped around on either
side, were eagerly peering forward to ascertain the
cause of their alarm.</p>

<p>Curiosity, repulsion, and horror—horror wild
and undiluted—were now depicted on every countenance
as the gently heaving boards, slipping
noiselessly asunder, revealed two hideous heads,
rising as it were from the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, with a gradation suggestive
of machinery, the phantoms I knew so well at length
came into full view. But stupendous as was the
sensation this unlooked-for tableau produced, not a
sound was uttered—and, as if to accentuate the
silence, the music broke off abruptly, dancers,
audience, and orchestra being similarly affected.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the female phantom, clutching
in one arm its loathsome burden, paused irresolutely
beside its tomb—and then, shaking a hand in the
direction of the Honourable Walter, it made a
sudden dart at the spot where he stood.</p>

<p>A thrill of the most intense horror accompanied
this unexpected movement, all eyes being now
transferred to the wretched youth.</p>

<p>I gave one glance at my cousin Robert—I dare
not look again—his expression was frightful—he
could do nothing to help his son—his position was
that of the damned.</p>

<p>The crucial moment arrived—no one breathed—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Things from the Grave reached Walter—there
was no hesitation—they passed <span class="lowcap">RIGHT THROUGH</span>
him. I looked at the wall, I rubbed my eyes—the
spectres had vanished!</p>

<p>A convulsive throb now ran through the assemblage,
the revellers exchanged frightened and
embarrassed glances, there was a general movement
to the door, the room emptied, the dance was
over.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span></p>

<p>I did not see her ladyship again—I merely
received a message of farewell, but Robert came to
say good-bye.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said, gazing at me with his pensive
harrowed eyes, “I wonder very much if the ghosts
appeared to you when alone in that room? If so
you have indeed been brave, and to keep it secret
served us right. The story of the hauntings,” he
continued, “has up to the present been revealed only
to the male members of our family, but to you I
feel that an explanation is due. At any rate, you
are a Wentworth and have given me ample proof that
you may with safety be entrusted with a secret.</p>

<p>“It seems years ago that one of my ancestors got
entangled in some way or another with a beautiful
gipsy. She begged him to marry her; he refused;
and fearful lest the affair should leak out and so
bring discredit upon the family, he murdered her,
burying her body, together with that of her child,
underneath the ballroom floor. At least so the MS.
states, and no one, as far as I am aware, has ever
disproved it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tortured with remorse and a victim to the
orthodox fears of a murderer, my unhappy forefather
took poison, commanding in his will ‘that the ballroom
should never again be used for a frivolous
purpose,’ an injunction which, until last night, has
been faithfully obeyed.</p>

<p>“The Wentworths, as you may naturally suppose,
have kept the story strictly to themselves—the male
heirs alone being usually acquainted with it.</p>

<p>“I did not altogether credit the story of the
haunting though my father swore he had seen the
cursed apparitions. Moreover he told me that they
appeared periodically—every night at 11 <span class="lowcap">P.M.</span> from
the 20th to the 31st of December. He also warned
me, and here I am much to blame, on no account to
permit any outsider to be in the room, ‘for if you
do,’ he added, ‘<span class="lowcap">THEN</span>, something terrible will
happen.’ I own I was sceptical and bitterly I
regret it now. I had never seen an apparition, and
what my father told me he had seen, I attributed to
Suggestion, the natural consequence of dwelling too
much on the horrible details of the story.</p>

<p>“Maud shared my scepticism and when she
wanted to use the room, brought forward the most
ingenious arguments to overcome my scruples.</p>

<p>“I declared it was impossible—it would be sheer
sacrilege. I was accused of inconsistency. I disbelieved!
how then could there be any danger!—the
injunction in the will was unreasonable and
absurd. In short, I had no peace, I had to yield,
so making the stipulation that we should first find
out some means by which we could prove that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
there was no foundation for the story of the haunting,
I reluctantly gave my consent.</p>

<p>“Somewhat to my astonishment, Maud had
already formed a plan for testing the room. She
had heard me speak of you, you were a Wentworth;
if you discovered anything we could rely
on you to keep it secret—and so my wife suggested
that you should be put in the room, ‘just to sample
it.’ I hesitated, I did not speak. I suppose my
silence gave consent: the rest you know. I won’t
press you to tell me if you saw those beastly things,
if you did the sequel only serves us right. Anyhow
nothing can excuse my having sanctioned disobedience
to that injunction in the will.</p>

<p>“The fact and the nature of the haunting is a
secret no longer—the cause none but a Wentworth
shall ever know.</p>

<p>“I need hardly enjoin you who are one of us to
maintain silence on that point.</p>

<p>“We shall shut up the house for a time, until, in
fact, the worst of the affair has blown over—and—when
we meet again, let us hope it will be under
happier circumstances.”</p>

<p>We never met again; within six months of my
departure, both Robert and his son were dead—killed
in a motor accident abroad. The property
is now in the hands of distant, of <span class="lowcap">VERY</span> distant
relations, and I feel no compunction in saying what
I know about it.</p>

<p>Only—if you repeat this to Mr. Elliott O’Donnell,
please substitute fictitious names.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Between</span> my exit from the stage in 1900 up till
quite recently I had the great, the very great misfortune
to be a teacher in a small town in the north
of England.</p>

<p>I say misfortune because I found the contrasts
between exciting stageland and the monotonous
schoolroom, between the generous and jovial
theatrical fraternity and the mean and petty local
parents, too decidedly pronounced to be other than
excessively unpleasant.</p>

<p>I had small patience with the mediocre abilities of
very mediocre children, and still less with the continual
and unwarrantable interference of their ill-mannered
and doting mothers. No lot in life could
have been more thoroughly uncongenial than mine;
indeed, it would have soon become unbearable had
it not been for the constant influx of strangers whose
presence in the town made an oasis in the desert.</p>

<p>It is to one of these visitors—Miss Medley—that
I owe the following story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some years ago,” she began, “I received an
invitation to spend August with a very crochety old
aunt of mine residing at Burle Farm, North Devon.</p>

<p>“There was nothing at all extraordinary in the
appearance of the house; it belonged to a type
common in all parts of England. It was a low,
rambling building of yellow stone with a good,
substantial, thatched roof and ample stabling. The
rooms, sweet with the scent of jasmine and honeysuckle,
compared more than favourably with the
stuffy dens in which I had been obliged to live in
London; whilst the diamond-shaped window-panes
and massive oak beams serving as supports to the
ceilings, struck me as being quite delightfully
quaint.</p>

<p>“My aunt, too—a rosy-faced old lady in a mob-cap—appeared
quite in harmony with her surroundings.
She was kindness itself—indeed, no one could
have made me feel more thoroughly at home.</p>

<p>“‘Folks do say the house is haunted,’ she laughed,
‘particularly one room—but there! I have never
seen anything, and I don’t suppose you will.’</p>

<p>“‘A ghost!’ I cried, ‘how awfully exciting! oh!
do let me sleep in the haunted room,’ and I continued
to plead till the kind-hearted old lady
reluctantly consented.</p>

<p>“‘You mustn’t blame me if the ghost should visit
you, Rosie,’ she said; ‘remember I have warned
you.’</p>

<p>“‘There is nothing I should enjoy better than
seeing a real <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona-fide</i> spook, auntie dear,’ I
rejoined, smiling; but my aunt shook her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
reprovingly, and no more was said on the subject
until the next day.</p>

<p>“I awoke that night as the clock struck two—indeed,
I fancied my awakening was due to that
striking, it seemed so unusually loud and emphatic.</p>

<p>“It was a fine—indeed, I might say glorious—night,
for although there was no moon, the heavens
were so brilliantly illuminated with myriads of
scintillating stars, that I could see every object
around me almost as clearly as if it had been day.</p>

<p>“A sudden movement near the foot of the bed
made me recollect my aunt’s admonition. I listened,
experiencing none of those pleasant anticipations of
which I had spoken so boastfully.</p>

<p>“I knew no one could have entered the room, as
I had taken the precaution to lock the door, having
first of all looked under the bed and made a thorough
examination of the hanging wardrobe. Consequently
my visitor, unless a mouse or a rat, could be nothing
material.</p>

<p>“I devoutly wished I had slept in one of the other
rooms.</p>

<p>“A faint and sickly odour now became perceptible
whilst the noise hitherto uninterpretable developed
into a series of unequal knocks just as if some big
animal were lying on the floor ‘scratching’ itself.</p>

<p>“Determined not to appear frightened I put my
hand out of bed and called ‘Trot! Trot! is that
you?’ (Trot being the name of my auntie’s
retriever.)</p>

<p>“Something instantly jumped up and, coming
round the bed, stood by my side. Wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
whether it could be Trot, though at a loss to understand
how he could have got into the room without
being seen, I stretched out my fingers and to my
intense relief touched a furry coat—the stench at
the same time becoming so truly awful that I
retched.</p>

<p>“I could, of course have satisfied myself as to the
identity of my visitor by merely looking, but this, I
am ashamed to say, I was too great a coward to do;
a strange feeling telling me that I was in the
presence of something unnatural.</p>

<p>“Running my hand fearfully along the shaggy skin
of the animal, I felt for its head, discovering to my
intense horror that it had none, the neck terminating
in a wet mass of something soft and spongy.</p>

<p>“Unable to restrain myself any longer, I now
looked, perceiving to my infinite terror a huge
shock-haired spaniel, headless, and in the most
abominable state of decomposition.</p>

<p>“I gazed at it for some seconds too appalled either
to stir or utter a sound—this paralytic condition
continuing till an abortive effort of the phantasm to
jump on the bed loosened my tongue and I shrieked
for help.</p>

<p>“The dog immediately vanished.</p>

<p>“My feelings had been, however, so outraged by
what I had witnessed that nothing would have
induced me to pass the remainder of the night in
that room—my own idea was to get out of it with
the utmost celerity.</p>

<p>“I did so—nor did I ever again—not even by
daylight—venture to cross its threshold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“My aunt, poor dear, was very much upset at the
occurrence.</p>

<p>“She could not imagine how it was other people
could see the ghost while she could not. And her
scepticism was but natural; she was unable to
grasp the idea that the psychic faculty is a gift, only
granted to the few, and as rare as that either of
music or painting.</p>

<p>“Other reasons for her incredulity in this particular
occult manifestation lay in the enigmatical nature
and purport of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>“In what category of ghosts would one classify a
headless dog; Was it the spirit of a dog that had
been decapitated on earth?</p>

<p>“She had never gathered from the Scriptures that
beasts had souls—what then was this phantom of a
dog?</p>

<p>“I suggested it might be a Poltergeist or Elemental,
one of those purely bestial creations that for various
reasons which you explained at your recent lecture—always
haunt certain localities?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” I said, interrupting Miss Medley, “the
sub-animal type of elemental is fairly common—if
you refer to the June number 1908 of the magazine
published by the Society for Psychical Research you
will see an extremely well authenticated case of the
haunting of a village by a white pig with an abnormally
long snout and I could enumerate many other
similar instances. But continue!”</p>

<p>“My aunt,” Miss Medley went on, “informed
me that the house had once been occupied by a lady
who had lived a very selfish—not to say sensual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
life. She had settled down at Burle, after having
been divorced twice, and her weekly routine was
one incessant whirl of pleasure.</p>

<p>“She died without the consolation of the Church,
surrounded by a crowd of fawning money-hunters
and over-gorged poodles, so that for this, as well
as other reasons I think there may be an alternative
solution to the haunting. Is it not possible that
what I saw was actually the spirit of this worldly
woman, which thoroughly brutalised by long indulgence
in sensuality had gradually adapted that
shape most befitting <span class="lowcap">IT</span>.”</p>

<p>“And the moral of that, Miss Medley,” I observed,
“is—if you do not wish to become a beast do not
live like one! Yes! there is much to be learned
from a study of the different types of phantasms—more
I believe than from any pulpit discourses.
Is that your only psychic experience?”</p>

<p>Miss Medley shook her head. “No!” she said,
“I had another very gruesome one at Burle. After
the dog episode my aunt thought fit to warn me
not to pass along a certain road after dusk. ‘There
is an elm standing close to it,’ she said, ‘which the
people about here declare to be haunted; as you
have seen one ghost you may see another—so please
be careful!’</p>

<p>“Now you might think that after such a disagreeable
experience I would have followed my aunt’s
advice, but curiosity getting the better of discretion
I disobeyed her and, selecting a fine evening for
the enterprise, set out to the tree.</p>

<p>“As it was two or three miles away, and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
dearly fond of riding, I hired a horse and going
along at a jog-trot approached the forbidden spot
at about eight o’clock.</p>

<p>“The lane in which the haunted elm stood was
narrow, trees of all sorts and sizes lined it on either
side, and the shadows, intensified by the thickness
of the foliage overhead, almost obliterated the roadway.</p>

<p>“All was dark and silent. I no longer wondered
at the villagers fighting shy of such a place; it
looked a positive cock-pit of spookdom.</p>

<p>“At about twenty or so yards from the notorious
elm my horse showed unmistakable signs of uneasiness,
laying back its ears and shivering to such
an extent that it was only by dint of alternate threats
and caresses that I succeeded in urging it forward.
Arriving at a spot level with the tree the animal
shied, and had I not been a pretty good horse-woman
I might have met with a nasty accident, but
I stuck to my seat like a leech, and using my whip
smartly drew in the reins. My horse fell back on
its haunches; reared—plunged headlong forward—took
the bit between its teeth and—we were off like
the wind.</p>

<p>“Fortunately I was prepared; leaning back in my
saddle I enjoyed rather than otherwise so mad a
career. But my pleasure received a sudden check
when I perceived, to my horror, the figure of a tall
woman dressed in black striding along by the side
of us and keeping pace with us without any apparent
effort.</p>

<p>“Heaven alone knew where she came from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>unless
from the tree; I fancied I had heard something
drop from the branches at the moment my horse
shied. As the woman was wearing a cloak drawn
over her head, I could not see her face but from
the grotesque outlines of her limbs and body, I
concluded it must be unpleasantly bizarre.</p>

<p>“We kept together in this extraordinary fashion
until we came in sight of Burle, when she quickened
her steps, and tearing off the hood thrust her face
upwards into mine.</p>

<p>“It was awful—utterly and inconceivably <span class="lowcap">AWFUL</span>—so
awful that I felt the very marrow in my bones
freeze with horror while my heart stood still.</p>

<p>“She had no hair; her head was round and shiny,
whilst her face, yellow and swollen, was covered all
over with circular black spots causing it to bear a
striking resemblance to one of those old-fashioned
carriage dogs!!! Her eyes were black and sinister;
she had no nose, whilst her mouth was—horrid—the
most horrid thing about her.</p>

<p>“With a diabolical grin she grabbed at my jacket
and would, I believe, have torn me from my seat
had we not at this moment, in the very nick of time,
arrived within sight of the gates of Burle Farm.</p>

<p>“My aunt, with several other people, was awaiting
me, and as with a desperate spurt I galloped up to
them, the infernal hag let go her hold of my jacket,
slackened her pace and vanished.”</p>

<span class="stl">THE MAN IN THE FLOWERY DRESSING-GOWN<br />
AND THE BLACK CAT</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Technical form of apparitions: Phantoms of the
dead and possibly animal: Elemental.</p>

<p>Cause of haunting: Murder</p>

<p>Source of authenticity: First-hand evidence</p>
</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Should</span> any one wonder why I continually select
Northamptonshire and Gloucestershire as the scenes
of my ghost stories, let me hasten to explain that my
reason is obvious enough—with both these counties
I have had a lifelong intimacy and naturally have
had more facilities and opportunities for collecting
suitable material from them than from any other.</p>

<p>I have not the slightest doubt other counties can
show equally long lists of haunted houses, only I
have not found them so easy of access, moreover the
genial nature of the inhabitants of Northamptonshire
(especially) has attracted as well as aided me in my
research, and although the burly Midland yeoman
is inclined to scoff at things superphysical, his satire
is not so objectionable as is that of the supercilious
middle-class Londoner.</p>

<p>Again, Northamptonshire is very rich in well preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
old country mansions—I know of no other
county where there are so many—and as most of
these houses have at one time or another witnessed
some grim tragedy, it is not surprising that they are
now the scenes of occult manifestations.</p>

<p>Doubtless one would find similar phenomena in
smaller habitations were the latter of the same early
date, for crime was then just as prevalent among the
poor as among the rich, but the inferior material with
which cottages have been built causes their comparatively
speaking early dissolution, and we rarely
find a cottage now standing which was built more
than a century ago.</p>

<p>From this it must not be deduced that hauntings are
confined to old buildings nor that past crime alone
begat ghosts; nothing of the sort, modern villas are
frequently subjected to psychic phenomena whilst the
phantoms of present-day suicides and murderers are
decidedly as numerous as of yore.</p>

<p>But whereas in olden times, crime was fairly
common in villages, it is now chiefly confined to
towns, and the houses that have witnessed murders,
&amp;c., are not infrequently entirely demolished or
made to undergo some very radical alterations—hence
the ghosts disappear with their surroundings.</p>

<p>This more so, perhaps, in the provinces than in
London, as there are too many crimes in the latter
for any particular one to be remembered for any
length of time, not long enough in fact to permanently
damn the letting of a house.</p>

<p>The word ghost is very elastic, it may be used in
reference to many different types of spirits, and is, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
fact, only the designation for that genus of which
the departed soul of man is but a species.</p>

<p>Now Northamptonshire is very rich in species;
species of all kinds; spirits of men, of beasts, of
vegetables! and species of elementals—elemental
being in itself, a genus which includes many various
types, too numerous indeed, for any attempt at classification
in this work.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon thing to meet with some
locality (usually barren) or village (generally on the
site of barrows or Druidical remains as, for example,
Guilsborough) where the nature of the hauntings is
dual; a complexity that is, fortunately, of rarer
occurrence in houses.</p>

<p>Concerning the latter, Lee mentions one instance,
<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, “The Gybe Farm,” in his book, “More
Glimpses of the Unseen World” whilst I will take
this opportunity to quote another case of dual
haunting, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, Carne House, which is situated at the
utmost extremity of a village to the south-east of
Northampton.</p>

<p>My informant, Mrs. Norton, frequently resided in
the house in her childhood and youth, and it was
from her lips that I heard the following story which
I recollect only too well.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span><span class="sp1">*</span></p>

<p>My first impression of Carne House was one of
extreme aversion; I can see it now as I saw it then—vast,
sleek, and white, like some monstrous toadstool,
or slimy fungus.</p>

<p>Bathed in the moonlight—for we did not arrive
till late—it confronted us with audacious nudity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
not a plant or shrub being trained to hide its naked
sides. There was something unspeakably loathsome
in the boldness of its carriage—something that made
me glance with fear at its wide and gaping windows
and glance again as I crossed the threshold into the
dark and lofty hall.</p>

<p>The passages of the house, both in number and
sinuosity, resembled a maze; they recalled to my
youthful mind the story of Dædalus, and I half
expected to see the figure of the Minotaur suddenly
arise from some gloomy corner and pursue me
through the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Nor were my fears entirely groundless, for I had
hardly been in the place a month before I had a
very unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>Chancing one morning to go on an errand for
my mother to a room that had in all probability
once served as a laundry, but which was now restricted
to lumber, I was startled at hearing something
move either in or on the copper. Thinking
it must be some stray animal, or, may be, a rat, I
threaded my way through a sea of packing cases,
and standing on tip-toe, peeped very cautiously into
the copper.</p>

<p>To my intense surprise I found myself looking
into a very deep and sepulchral well, at the bottom
of which was a man. I could see him distinctly,
owing to a queer kind of light that seemed to
emanate from every part of his body. He was
draped in a phantastic costume that might have
been a kimono or one of those flowery dressing-gowns
worn by our great-great-grandfathers. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was bending over a box which he was doing his
best to conceal under a pile of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>, and it was
undoubtedly this noise that had attracted me.</p>

<p>Too intent on his work, he was apparently
unaware of my close proximity, until, satisfied that
the box was well hidden, he straightened his back
and looked up.</p>

<p>His face frightened me; not that it was anything
out of the normal either in feature or complexion,
but it was the expression—the look of evil joy that
suffused every lineament before he saw me, changing
to one of the most diabolical fury as our eyes
met. I was at first too transfixed with terror to do
more than stare, and it was only when, crouching
down, he took a sudden and deliberate spring at the
wall and began to climb it like a spider, that I
regained possession of my limbs, and turning round,
fled for my life.</p>

<p>Oh! how long that room seemed and what an
interminable succession of furniture now appeared
to barricade the way.</p>

<p>Every yard was a mile, every instant I expected
he would clutch me.</p>

<p>I reached the door only just in time—happily for
me it was open—I darted out, and as I did so the
outlines of a hand—large and ill-shapen—shot fruitlessly
past me.</p>

<p>The next moment I was in the kitchen—the servants
were there—I was saved—saved from a fate
that would assuredly have sent me mad.</p>

<p>When I related what had happened, to my mother,
she laughingly informed me I must have been dreaming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that there was <span class="lowcap">NO WELL</span> there, nor was there
any man in the house save my father and the servants;
yet I fancied I could detect beneath those
smiling assurances a faint and scarcely perceptible
horror—and she never let me visit that room again—alone!</p>

<p>But was I dreaming—was there no well, and had
that man been but the fancy of a childish and distorted
brain?</p>

<p>Sometimes I answered “Yes,” and sometimes
“No.”</p>

<p>After this little incident, a manifest, though of
necessity, subtle change took place in our household;
the servants became infected with a general
spirit of uneasiness, which although only shown in
my presence by their looks, convinced and alarmed
me far more than any fears, even the most terrible,
would have done had they been outspoken. I was
positive they lived in daily anticipation of something
very dreadful—something that lay concealed in
those dark and tortuous corridors or in that grim
and ghostly room.</p>

<p>My dreams at night were horrible, nor did I again
feel that in this respect I was singular as I overheard
some one remark that no one ever passed the
night without awakening with a sudden and inexplicable
start.</p>

<p>I say inexplicable—would that it had always
remained so!</p>

<p>It was August when my next definite adventure
occurred. I use the word definite as I had had
several other experiences, but of too brief and uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a nature to enable me to draw any precise
conclusions.</p>

<p>Once, as I had been walking along one of the
passages, I had heard the noise of something clanking,
and had been put to instant flight by the sound
of heavy footsteps echoing suddenly in my rear, and
again—but this isn’t really worth recording; let me
proceed with that night in August.</p>

<p>Well, I slept in a room at the end of a corridor,
my nearest neighbour, Miss Dovecot our governess,
occupying a chamber some dozen yards away. I do
not think I need describe any article of furniture the
room contained; every piece was strictly modern,
and had been brought with us from a newly furnished
house in Sevenoaks. The fireplace and cupboard
are, however, deserving of comment; the former
was one of those old-fashioned ingles Burns delights
in describing, and which are now so seldom to be
seen; an inn at Dundry, near Bristol, containing, I
believe, the finest specimen in the kingdom; whilst
the latter, which I always kept securely locked at
night, was of such far-reaching dimensions that it
might well be termed in modern phraseology a linen
room.</p>

<p>On the night in question, I had gone to bed at my
usual time—eight—and I had speedily fallen to sleep,
as I was in the habit of doing; but my slumber was
by no means normal.</p>

<p>I was tortured with a series of disturbing dreams,
from which I awoke with a start to hear some clock
outside sonorously strike twelve. As an additional
proof of my wakefulness, I might add (pardon my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
explicitness) I was sensibly affected by a constant
irritation of the skin, due, I believe, to a disordered
state of the liver, which in itself was a sufficient
preventive to further sleep.</p>

<p>It must have been half-past twelve when I heard,
to my intense horror, the cupboard door—which
I distinctly recollect locking—slowly, very slowly,
open.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to make a precipitate rush
for the door, but, alas! I soon became aware that I
was powerless to act; a kind of catalepsy, coming
on suddenly, held my body as in a vice, whilst my
senses, on the other hand, had grown abnormally
acute.</p>

<p>In this odious condition I was now compelled to
listen to the Thing—whatever it might be—slowly
crossing the floor in the direction of my bed.</p>

<p>The climax at length came, and my cup of horrors
overflowed, when, with an abruptness that was quite
unexpected (in spite of the direst apprehension), the
Thing leaped on the bed, and I discovered it to be
an enormous <span class="lowcap">CAT</span>.</p>

<p>I can unhesitatingly add the epithet—Black—for
the room, which a moment before was shrouded in
darkness, had now become a blaze of light, enabling
me to perceive the colour as well as the outline with
the most unpleasant perspicuity.</p>

<p>It was not only in intensity of colour (the blackest
ebony could not have been blacker) that the cat was
abnormal, but in every other respect; its dimensions
were not far removed from those of a large bull-dog,
and its expression—the eyes and mouth of the beast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
were more than bestial—was truly Satanic. Stalking
over my legs, its tail almost perpendicular and
swaying slightly like the nodding plumes of a
hearse, it squatted down between the bedposts opposite,
transfixing me with a stare full of malevolent
meaning.</p>

<p>I was so fully occupied in watching it and trying
to solve the enigma I saw so plainly written in its
every gesture, that I did not realise I had other
visitors, till a sudden uncertain twitching in the light
made me look round. I then perceived with a start
a fire was burning in the grate.</p>

<p>A fire, and in August—how incongruous! I
shivered.</p>

<p>But it was no delusion; the flames soared aloft,
adopting a hundred fantastic yet natural shapes;
the coals burned hollow, and in their crimson and
innermost recesses I read the future.</p>

<p>But not for long. My cogitations were unceremoniously
interrupted by the appearance of the
man-in-the-well, whom I was startled to perceive
seated in the chimney-corner in the most nonchalant
attitude possible—nursing a baby!</p>

<p>Anomalous and mirth-provoking as is such a sight
in the usual way, the existing circumstances were
grim enough to excite my horror and raise anew my
worst forebodings.</p>

<p>Supposing he saw me now? There was no
escape! I was entirely at his mercy. What would
he do?</p>

<p>I glanced from him to the cat, and from the cat
back again to him. Of my two enemies, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
most to be feared? The slightest movement on my
part would inevitably arouse them both, and bring
about my immediate destruction. The situation did
not even warrant my breathing.</p>

<p>The minutes sped by with the most tantalising
slowness. The clock struck one, and neither of my
visitors had budged an inch—the man in the flowery
dressing-gown still nursing the baby, and the black
cat still staring at me. Mine was indeed a most
unenviable position, and I was despairing of its ever
being otherwise, when a sudden transmutation in
the man sent a flow of icy blood to my heart.</p>

<p>He no longer regarded his burden indifferently—he
scowled at it.</p>

<p>The scowl deepened, the utmost fury pervaded his
features, converting them into those of a demon.
He got up, gnashed his teeth, stamped on the ground,
and lifting up the child, dropped it head first into
the fire. I saw it fall. I heard it burn!</p>

<p>The hideous cruelty of the man, the abruptness of
his action, proved my undoing. Oblivious of personal
danger, I shrieked.</p>

<p>The effect was electrical. Dropping the poker,
with which he had been holding down the baby, the
inhuman monster swung round and saw me.</p>

<p>The expression in his face at once became hellish,
absolutely hellish.</p>

<p>My only chance of salvation now lay in making
the greatest noise possible, and I had commenced
to shout for help lustily, when at a signal from the
man, the enormous black cat crouched and sprang.</p>

<p>What followed I cannot exactly remember, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
dim recollections of feeling a heavy thud and of
some one or some <span class="lowcap">THING</span> trying to tear away the
clothes from my head, after which there came a
very complete blank, and when I recovered consciousness,
the anxious countenances of my parents
and governess were bending over me.</p>

<p>The next night I slept with my sister.</p>

<p>My health had been so impaired by these encounters,
that my parents decided to move elsewhere;
the furniture was once again packed, and
within a month of the above incident we had taken
up our abode in Clifton, Bristol.</p>

<p>The history of the hauntings was subsequently
revealed to me by the owner of the house. It had
once been inhabited by a man of the name of
Darby, who seems to have been a sort of wholesale
butcher.</p>

<p>His elder brother dying, the family estate passed
to the latter’s eldest son, a child of two, and Darby
determining to succeed to the property, invited the
widow to stay with him. She did so—she was a
weakly creature—and he got rid of her by putting
her to sleep in a damp bed. The children were
next disposed of, the younger by being burnt (as I
had witnessed) and the elder, aged two, by being
smothered to death by a black cat. Darby is said
to have deliberately made the cat sit upon the infant’s
mouth as it lay asleep. But these rapid
deaths, as might have been expected, aroused suspicions.
The nurse, who had been an unwilling party
to the burning of the baby, turned King’s Evidence,
and a warrant for his arrest was issued. As is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the case, however, the officers of the law were a bit
too late. When they arrived at the house, the quarry
had flown, nor could his whereabouts be discovered
for many years; not, indeed, till fifty years after the
crimes, when his skeleton was found at the bottom
of a disused well he had himself sunk in one of the
back kitchens. Under the skeleton lay an iron box
containing many valuables, rings, &amp;c., which he had
been doubtless striving to hide when death in some
unaccountable form or another overtook him. What
became of the cat, history does not say.</p>

<p>The place had always borne a reputation for being
haunted—it was on that account my parents had
got it at so low a rental—and the ghosts seen there
(undoubtedly those of Darby and his cat) corresponded
in every detail with the phenomena that
had so terrified me.</p>

<p>I am aware that many deny the existence of souls
in animals—let them do so—but do not let them be
too dogmatical, for where Life ends all is mystery.</p>

<p>Still there is an alternative theory to account for
the appearance of animal phantoms, which is, I
think, quite within the realms of possibility: the
black cat I saw, if not the spirit of the one made
such hideous use of by the old man, was undoubtedly
an elemental—a spirit representative of a popular
crime, a vice—Darby’s evil genius—that ever hovered
at his heels in his lifetime and is more loth than
ever to leave him now that his physical body is dead
and his soul earthbound.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> following account of a haunted house is taken
from the diary of a gentleman—since deceased. The
narrator was the owner of the house, and, being a professional
man, asked me to give fictitious names, lest
the publication of the story should be detrimental
both to his practice and to the letting of the place:</p>

<p>“Before I commence my story,” he writes, “I
think it expedient to state that both my parents are
dead, my father having died many years ago and my
mother quite recently. The latter had lived to the
very ripe age of ninety, had possessed an unusually
strong will, was a most devout Roman Catholic,
and took the deepest interest in everything that
concerned our welfare. She had two peculiarities:
(1) A strange aversion to children; (2) a positive
loathing and dread of blackbeetles. The house
stands alone, some thirty yards or so from the road,
and is well concealed from view by a high brick
wall and numerous trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are four bedrooms upstairs, two on either
side of the landing—which for clearness I will
number—viz., No. 1 occupied by my wife and I;
No. 2 my sister Mary’s room; No. 3 my sister Joan’s
room; No. 4 the spare bedroom in which my
mother died. The top storey consists of two attics
inhabited by the servants.</p>

<p>“January 1, 1906, we first became aware of the
disturbances—violent knockings being heard about
midnight on the walls and floor of room No. 4.
On hurriedly entering it, we could discover nothing.
But on leaving the room the noises were repeated
and kept up till two or three in the morning.</p>

<p>“January 5. A recurrence of the disturbance—only
much louder.</p>

<p>“January 6. Have in a carpenter who makes a
thorough examination of the wainscoting and reports
‘no traces of rats, mice nor any other
animals.’</p>

<p>“January 10. Tremendous knockings again in
room No. 4, the door of which is swinging to and
fro violently. A loud clatter on landing as though
half a dozen children were engaged in the roughest
horse-play. The uproar terminates in a terrific crash
on the panel of No. 3 door. Joan rushes out of her
bedroom thinking the house is on fire and sees a
strange, green light some six by two feet long moving
across the landing. It disappears in room No. 4.</p>

<p>“January 15. We are all awakened by a loud
crash and on reaching the landing find a big, black
oak chest from the coach-house, lying there on its
back. Every one much alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“February 1. My sister Mary awakened at midnight
by feeling something tickle her cheeks. She
puts out her hand to brush it away and encounters
something cold and scaly. Her shrieks of terror
bring us all into her bedroom—there is nothing
there.</p>

<p>“February 3. My wife and I are aroused by feeling
our bed gently lifted up and down, and on my
getting out for a light, I tread on something indescribably
disgusting. It feels like a monstrous
insect!!</p>

<p>“February 4. The knocking very bad all night—particularly
in room No. 4.</p>

<p>“February 5, 6, 7, ditto.</p>

<p>“February 10. The clothes mysteriously taken off
Joan’s bed and transported to room No. 2.</p>

<p>“February 15. Both servants undergo our experience
of February 3.</p>

<p>“February 16. The knockings still continued
and distant sounds heard as of some one coming
upstairs and turning the handles of all the room
doors.</p>

<p>“February 17. Scufflings on the landings, and in
the passage as though caused by a troop of very
noisy children.</p>

<p>“February 19. Knockings in room No. 2. The
washstand and a heavy mahogany wardrobe moved
some feet out of their places. Mary, who was awake
at the time, saw the shunting of the furniture, but
could detect no sign of any agent.</p>

<p>“March 1. About 8.30 <span class="lowcap">A.M.</span> after Martha had laid
the breakfast things she went downstairs to finish a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
cup of tea. On her return to the breakfast room
she found it in the wildest state of disorder; chairs
over-turned, ashpan and front of grate removed to
furthest extremity of room, all the pictures taken
down from the walls and laid face upwards on the
floor, and the cups, saucers, plates, knives and forks
piled in one heap in centre of table; all this had
been done without either breakage or noise.</p>

<p>“Terrified out of her wits Martha rushed upstairs
to our door, and nothing would induce her to enter
the breakfast room again alone.</p>

<p>“March 3. On returning home about 10 <span class="lowcap">P.M.</span> from
a neighbouring town, we found the servants sitting
huddled together, half dead with fright in the kitchen.
They had heard knockings and the most appalling
thuds ever since we had gone out; and on entering
our room (No. 1) we found it in an absolute
turmoil: the bed-clothes in a promiscuous pile on
the floor, the duchess table turned round with its
face to the wall, the pictures ditto—but—nothing
broken.</p>

<p>“March 15. Awakened in middle of night by three
loud crashes in room No. 3, after which we distinctly
heard our door open and some one crawl
stealthily under our bed.</p>

<p>“We at once lit a candle—no one was there.</p>

<p>“March 18. Knockings in both the attics. The
servants badly scared.</p>

<p>“March 21. As Joan was running downstairs
about mid-day, she received a violent bang on her
back as if some one had hit her with the palm of
their hand. She came to my study in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
exhausted condition, and it took her some minutes
to recover.</p>

<p>“March 24. Found my mother’s shoes, which we
were certain had been locked up in a bureau, placed
where she had always placed them in her lifetime—<abbr>i.e.</abbr>,
on the hearth-rug before the dining-room
fire.</p>

<p>“March 31. My mother’s favourite arm-chair
found upside down in front of the fire-place in
room No. 4.</p>

<p>“April 2, 11 <span class="lowcap">P.M.</span> As Mary was stooping to look
under the bed for fear of burglars, she was suddenly
pushed down and the mattresses and bedclothes
were thrown on the top of her. Her frantic
struggles and muffled screams being, fortunately,
overheard by my wife (I was in London at the
time), she was immediately extricated. No injury,
only bad shock.</p>

<p>“April 3, midnight. The contents of a large chest
of drawers in room No. 3 suddenly emptied on to
the floor. Loud crashes in all parts of the house.</p>

<p>“April 10, 11 <span class="lowcap">P.M.</span> On going up to bed, we find
room No. 4 aglow with a pale green light and filled
with a faint sickly odour, which we at once recognised
as identical with that smelt there at the time of my
mother’s decease and which we considered was
peculiar to her disease.</p>

<p>“I must mention that after her death, the room
had been thoroughly renovated, the old flooring
replaced by new, the walls repapered and everywhere
well disinfected with the strongest carbolic.
My mother had died at 11 <span class="smcap">P.M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></span></p>

<p>“April 12, 13, 14, 15; 11 <span class="lowcap">P.M.</span> The same light and
smell.</p>

<p>“April 20. Joan fell over some large obstacle in
the hall, hurting herself badly. She could see
nothing, but was half suffocated with a stench
similar to the one already described.</p>

<p>“April 30, 2.20 <span class="lowcap">A.M.</span> Both my wife and I distinctly
felt something brush across our faces. We
lit a candle and perceived to our horror two long
black antennæ (like the antennæ of a monstrous
beetle) waving to and fro on our pillow.</p>

<p>“We spent the rest of the night on the drawing-room
chairs and sofa.</p>

<p>“May 1. Shut up the house.”</p>

<span class="stl">THE INVISIBLE HORROR</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Technical form of haunting: Unknown</p>

<p>Source of authenticity: Personal and other experiences</p>

<p>Cause of haunting: Unknown</p>
</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> my boyhood days I was very fond of making long
excursions on foot, my peregrinations taking me
many miles from Bristol, which was at that time my
home. On one of these occasions I took a route
that led me past Bath, and eventually arrived at a
village that particularly fascinated me.</p>

<p>Lying in a hollow by the side of a sluggish river,
or stream, it presented an exceedingly attractive
appearance to my somewhat romantic eyes. I
especially liked the whitewashed cottages, with their
thatched roofs, diamond-fashioned window-panes,
walls and trellised arches covered with jasmine and
Virginian creepers; their tiny gardens crowded
with foxgloves and roses, and their quaint, their
very quaint chimney-pots, from which arose spiral
columns of fleecy-looking smoke.</p>

<p>It was a pretty village, a pre-eminently peaceful
village; a village that was rendered almost fantastic
by the close proximity of a queerly constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
water-mill; it was a sunny village, remarkably hot
in summer, but intensely cold in winter.</p>

<p>The stream to which I have alluded ran its
tortuous course through a succession of open
meadows. In the corner of one was a pond, a deep
and silent piece of water that was supposed to be
connected in some way with the miniature river.
It struck me as a very proper place for a bathe, the
weeping willows that fringed its margins affording
an effectual screen to the prying eyes of children;
whilst the gently sloping banks of spongy grass were
softer to the tread than any towel.</p>

<p>To add to my inducements the sun was unusually
hot, which made the thought of a bath very tempting
after my long tramp over dry monotonous roads.</p>

<p>Plunging in, I was, however, immeasurably surprised
to find that, despite the abnormal heat, the
water was icy cold, and that the scalding rays from
above did not appear to have the slightest effect on
the temperature.</p>

<p>Taking a few rapid strokes, I found myself nearing
the opposite bank, and was preparing to turn about
when a sudden panic seized me, and, fancying I was
being pursued, I scrambled ashore.</p>

<p>Seeing nothing, and consequently assured that
my fears were due to the trickeries of imagination, I
once again entered the water and was well on my
return voyage when I experienced the same sensation.
I seemed to feel the presence of some
extremely hostile and repulsive body—something
that lived in the pool and bitterly resented intrusion.
So strong was this feeling that I would not on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
account have bathed there again—at least, not
alone.</p>

<p>In response to my inquiries in the village, I
learned that the meadow, which went by the name
of “The Way,” bore a very evil reputation, being
carefully avoided by the local people after nightfall.
Though nothing had been actually seen there, those
who had attempted to cross the field in the dusk
emphatically declared they were assailed by an
“invisible something” that was indescribably cold
and horrid, and that they only escaped from it after
the most strenuous exertions.</p>

<p>Nothing short of force would induce a dog or a
horse to enter the meadow, and farmers fought shy
of letting their cattle graze there; indeed, should
any farmer be so foolish as to do so his beasts
invariably died.</p>

<p>I suppose I looked a trifle sceptical at this, as the
blacksmith remarked: “Don’t smile, sir; if you
saw Way Field, and especially the pool, after twilight,
you would form a very different idea of it to what
you do now. In the day-time it is, as you see, all
sunlight and daisies, an ideal spot for tea in the hay;
but in the evening the aspect undergoes a complete
change. The temperature is invariably lower there
than it is in any of the other meadows, whilst the
shadows that crowd upon the grass are not in the
least representative of any trees! Curious, sir, is
it not?”</p>

<p>I readily agreed it was curious, and I was so
deeply impressed by all that had occurred that, years
afterwards, when chance once again brought me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the district, I lost no time in setting off to visit the
pond.</p>

<p>To my astonishment it was gone, and its site was
now occupied by the kitchen garden of a large
house, evidently the abode of some person of
means.</p>

<p>I made inquiries and had but little difficulty in
obtaining an introduction to the owner who was
not only acquainted with what I already knew, but
was able and willing to give me further information,
with the stipulation, however, that on no account
must I mention either his name or that of the
locality. He wanted, he explained, to sell the place
and he could not hope to get a fair price for it, if
the story of the hauntings appeared in print.</p>

<p>“I have been here three years!” he began,
“during which time I have had no less than eight
housekeepers and twenty-five servants (my usual
staff consists of four); that signifies a good few
changes. Eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it has been a confounded nuisance!” he
went on, “none of them would stay on account of
the ghost! I pooh-poohed the thing at first, although
I honestly felt there was something very
queer about the place, but when one after another
came to me with the same yarns, I was obliged to
admit there might be something in it.</p>

<p>“Their complaints, though differing slightly in
small technicalities—due, perhaps, to their unequal
descriptive powers—were on the whole co-incidental;
frightful dreams, sudden awakenings without
any apparent cause, strange creakings on the staircases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the foot-falls of something soft and indefinable,
the rattling and turning of door handles, and over
and above everything else the most pronounced
feeling of insecurity.</p>

<p>“‘I won’t on any account remain downstairs after
the rest have gone to bed,’ one of my housekeepers
observed on my asking her to sit up for me, ‘the
very first night I stayed here—before I had heard
any rumour of the place being haunted—I underwent
the most unpleasant sensations on being left
alone. I instinctively felt some uncanny creature
had begun to walk the house as soon as the lights
were out. No, sir. I am ready and anxious to
fulfil all my other duties, save this, and if it is really
indispensable, why I fear, sir, you must get someone
else in my place.’</p>

<p>“This I promptly did, but all to no effect. The
newcomer had not been with me a week before she
approached me with a very woe-begone face.</p>

<p>“‘I am sorry, sir,’ she said, ‘I must give notice.
I am by no means nervous, indeed I have always
laughed at ghosts, but there is something unmistakably
the matter with this place, especially the
garden!’</p>

<p>“‘The garden!’ I exclaimed, ‘Come, it’s the first
time I have heard there’s anything amiss with the
garden.’</p>

<p>“‘But not the last, I’ll warrant you,’ she remarked
caustically. ‘Why sir, unless I am very much
mistaken, the origin of the disturbances lies in that
garden, over there,’ and she shot a bony forefinger
(why should housekeepers invariably have bony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
fingers?) in the direction of the filled-in pond.
‘As I was gathering some lettuce there last night I
felt (I could see nothing) some horribly cold and
sticky thing clasp me in its arms. It must have
been hiding among the raspberry canes. Struggling
with all my might I managed to free myself just as
a mass of fetid jelly was closing over my throat and
mouth. Oh! how desperately I struggled, and what
a blessed relief it was to be free from that loathsome
presence. I can assure you, sir, I ran across the
garden as fast as any girl, nor did I pause for one
second, till Johnson and one of the maids came to
my assistance. They did not ask me what had
happened, bless you sir, they knew! Nor was a
word said about it at supper, no one dare even as
much as mention the thing by gaslight!’</p>

<p>“It was useless, Mr. O’Donnell, to try and persuade
the woman to remain with me after <span class="lowcap">THAT</span>,
she went and, by the bye, I have just heard she has
recently undergone an operation for tumour in
some provincial hospital.</p>

<p>“With my next housekeeper I was rather more
fortunate. She stayed with me for more than six
months before showing any of the usual signs of
restlessness.</p>

<p>“Then she came to the point without the least
embarrassment, springing her surprise on me over
the breakfast cups.</p>

<p>“‘I must leave!’ she said demurely, proceeding
at the same time to pour out the coffee, ‘there is a
certain dampness here that is very trying to one
subject to rheumatism, as well as to one’s nerves.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“I started guiltily. ‘A dampness! Nerves! you
astonish me,’ I stammered, ‘pray explain yourself.’
She did so.</p>

<p>“‘What I mean is,’ she observed, ‘that I can
never enter the lower part of the kitchen garden
without being persistently followed by a “mist”—I
should have put it down to mere imagination, had
I not accidentally heard some one speak about the
ghost, and I at once concluded that the mist must
in some way be connected with it—am I not
right?’</p>

<p>“Of course I assented—what else could I do?</p>

<p>“‘I thought so,’ she went on demurely, ‘I suppose
you do not think it necessary to tell your applicants
the place is haunted?’</p>

<p>“I shook my head feebly and muttered: ‘Continue.’</p>

<p>“‘Last night,’ she said, ‘the mist was more pertinacious
than ever—it not only pursued me in the
garden, but came to my window after I had gone
to bed. I was looking at the moon when the temperature
of the room suddenly fell to zero, the
moonlight blurred, and to my amazement I saw the
mist clinging to the window-pane. Mr. ——, I am
not a nervous woman as a rule, but I wouldn’t stay
in this house another month under any conditions.’</p>

<p>“She went—and once again I had to go through
all the bother of advertising. The wretched thing
now began to haunt more vigorously than ever. It
attacked Emily, the cook, on the kitchen staircase,
and Mark, my general factotum, in the stables, both
leaving in consequence, and both being afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
taken very ill. Indeed it was the report of their
illness that prompted me to wage war against the
ghost—if I had to leave the house, it should not be
till I had ascertained something more definite about
my enemy. I would try and discover its identity—what
it actually was! With this end in view I laid
every trap imaginable, my ingenuity being at length
rewarded by finding a faint and barely perceptible
impression on the surface of a very large tray full of
a carefully prepared mixture of gelatine and wax.
I had placed the tray in one of the passages usually
frequented by the <span class="lowcap">EVIL PRESENCE</span>. On examining
the impression under a powerful microscope I
fancied I could detect innumerable granules composed
of radiating threads with bulbous terminations.</p>

<p>“Elated at my success and wondering very much
what it represented, I took a photograph of the
impression and sent it to a medical friend—a bacteriologist—in
London, whom I knew to be
interested in psychical research. In the course of
a few days he came to see me, and, pointing to the
wax tablet, remarked:</p>

<p>“‘I showed the photograph you sent me to some
of my colleagues, and we came to the conclusion
that the impression bore a distinct likeness to a
number of actinomyces, which, as you may know,
are a kind of fungi inimically disposed to every
kind of animal—cattle in particular. Indeed they
are in the main responsible for one of the most
common and deadly bovine diseases which is called
actinomycosis, and is acquired by cattle eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
infected barley or other cereal, the actinomyces
adhering to the tongue or jaw.</p>

<p>“‘In man the disease is very similar in its clinical
character and may be caused by a number of
organisms belonging to the streptothrix group (I fear
this is rather too technical for you) forming colonies
in the tissues and obtaining access to the body from
a carious tooth or not infrequently from the tonsil.</p>

<p>“‘The disease is sometimes wrongfully diagnosed
as tuberculosis; it usually occurs in farmers, millers,
and others who are brought in contact with grain;
it has a tendency to spread locally, and although
not dangerous in itself, may become so by attacking
important organs or by becoming generalised,
thereby giving rise to pyæmic abscesses in all parts
of the body.</p>

<p>“‘In the description of the assault on your housekeeper,
to which you gave special prominence (and
rightly so) in your letter, you mentioned that the
<span class="lowcap">EVIL PRESENCE</span> tried to “get at her mouth”—well
that would be in strict accordance with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</i> of actinomyces, the primary endeavour of
which is to obtain a passage through the lips.
Furthermore, you gathered from local gossip that
the unfortunate woman had undergone an operation
in some provincial hospital for tumours; now
tumours are usually one of the sure indications of
the nature and progress of the disease.</p>

<p>“‘Lastly, you referred to fatality in any cattle
allowed to graze in the haunted meadow. Now you
know from what I have already told you that cattle
are the favourite victims of the fungi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘From these deductions then, one must inevitably
arrive at the conclusion—that the haunting
here is due to nothing more or less than the phantasm
of a giant mass of <span class="lowcap">ACTINOMYCES</span>—and as this
type of spirit would undoubtedly be proof against
exorcism my only advice to you is to shut up the
house and go.’</p>

<p>“Afterwards, with a view to corroborate my
friend’s theory, partly for his satisfaction, partly for
my own, I am afraid, Mr. O’Donnell, I agreed to
rather a cruel thing—the proposal being that we
should experiment on one of our dogs—Spot.
Turning him loose in the lower extremity of the
garden, we took up a position in the loft of a
neighbouring barn, where we clearly saw each act
in the grim but exciting drama.</p>

<p>“To begin with, Spot did not at all appreciate
being left alone. From the very first he manifested
distinct signs of uneasiness, his preliminary barks of
disapproval speedily changing to those of fear and
culminating in howls of positive terror, as tucking
his tail between his legs, he careered madly round
the enclosure.</p>

<p>“He did not, however, keep up this pace for long,
but soon showed unmistakable signs of flagging,
coming to an abrupt halt sooner than we had
expected.</p>

<p>“The Evil Presence had, we felt sure, got hold
of him.</p>

<p>“Thrust back on his haunches and snapping
viciously, his eyes protruding and his mouth foaming,
poor Spot presented such an appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
impotence and terror that I rose to interfere and
would doubtless have done so, had I not been persuaded
to the contrary by my medical friend, whose
professional interests he either could not or would
not sacrifice for the sake of sentiment.</p>

<p>“Poor Spot eventually died, and our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i>
pointed to <span class="lowcap">ACTINOMYCOSIS</span>—his body being literally
perforated with abscesses.</p>

<p>“Thus you see, Mr. O’Donnell, in discovering the
identity of the phantasm I accomplished—in part at
all events—my purpose; the cause of the haunting
must, I am afraid, remain a mystery.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<span class="stl">THE GHASTLY SCREAMS ON<br />
THE STAIRCASE</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Technical form of apparition: Phantasm of dead</p>

<p>Cause of hauntings: Unknown</p>
</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Last</span> December I journeyed up from Cornwall, as
usual, to the annual concert given by my old school,
Clifton College, and at the subsequent House Supper
I made the acquaintance of several O.&nbsp;C.s who
were considerably my juniors in point of age.</p>

<p>We chatted together for a long time, and in the
course of our conversation touched upon the superphysical.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have a better authenticated instance
of a haunted house,” one of my young friends remarked,
“than that of No. —, Hackham Terrace,
Swindon. Isn’t that so, Neilson? You come from
Swindon.”</p>

<p>Neilson agreed.</p>

<p>“I know the people who live there,” my informant,
Jarvis, continued, “and they have seen and heard
the phantasm over and over again.”</p>

<p>“What form does it take?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A shrieking woman’s.”</p>

<p>“Like the ghost of Tehiddy,” I ejaculated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have never heard of the ghost of Tehiddy,”
Jarvis rejoined, “but I cannot conceive anything
more gruesome than the Hackham Terrace apparition.
Let me tell you some of Mrs. Belmont’s
experiences.</p>

<p>“You must know the house is quite new, the
Belmont’s being the first tenants, and that nothing
has been discovered, so far, that can in any way
account for the hauntings.</p>

<p>“To proceed, about a month after they had taken
the house, every one was aroused in the middle of
the night by a succession of the most unearthly
screams, coming, so it seemed, from the basement
of the house.</p>

<p>“For some seconds no one ventured out of their
rooms, and then, Mrs. Belmont very pluckily taking
the lead, other members of the family followed her
down-stairs.</p>

<p>“Arriving at the commencement of the passage
leading to the kitchen, they all saw an indefinable
black object lying on the ground.</p>

<p>“Frozen to the spot with horror, the Belmonts
watched the thing slowly rise, developing as it did
so until it assumed the appearance and dimensions
of a gigantic naked woman. But what was so inconceivably
horrid about her was the face: she had
no eyes, their places being filled by ordinary flesh.</p>

<p>“Confronting them for some moments in silence,
she suddenly and without the least warning assumed
a horizontal position in mid-air, dematerialised, and
passed through the wall in the guise of a rectangular
mass of pale blue light. Could anything be more
ghastly?”</p>

<p>“It has parallels in the luminous woman known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
as Proctor’s ghost, Wellington, near Newcastle, and
in a house, also new, in Portishead. Can you tell
me any further experiences there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jarvis rejoined; “one of the servants was
breaking coal in the cellar one evening, when the
hammer was unceremoniously snatched from her
hand, the candle blown out, and a blue, tatooed arm
thrust so roughly against her face that one of her
front teeth was actually loosened.</p>

<p>“She screamed, and the arm vanished.</p>

<p>“Still another incident: One of the Belmont
boys, Percy, was preparing to get into bed one
night, when something caught him sharply by the
foot, and looking down, he saw to his surprise a
large hairy hand encircling his ankle.</p>

<p>“He particularly noticed the nails, which, though
filbert in shape, were excessively long and dirty.</p>

<p>“Mumbling a prayer, the first that came into his
mind, he emphasised it by a violent kick. He could
not say which produced the desired effect—the
prayer or the kick—but the hand let go its hold, and
the next moment a shapeless mass of blue something
rising from the bed, and hovering for the briefest
duration of time on a level with his eyes, disappeared
through the ceiling.</p>

<p>“On another occasion, when Mrs. Belmont was in
the conservatory watering flowers, one of the pots
behind her suddenly fell to the ground with a crash.</p>

<p>“She turned round and found herself confronted
by a blue face that occupied the spot where the pot
had stood.</p>

<p>“Too dismayed and startled even to think of
escape, she stood rooted to the spot, gazing at the
evil thing in open-mouthed horror. What was it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Though resembling a man in contour and
features, its expression was too thoroughly bestial
to belong to anything human.</p>

<p>“The eyes, deep, sunken and lurid, leered malignantly
at her, whilst the mouth was distorted into a
diabolical grin.</p>

<p>“The apparition had no body.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Belmont is of the opinion she might have
stayed there till doomsday had not the unexpected
arrival of the gardener scared the thing away—it
disappeared as he entered the greenhouse door and
its place was once again taken by the flower-pot!</p>

<p>“Mrs. Belmont had another unpleasant experience
only this week.</p>

<p>“As she was crossing the landing to her bedroom
one morning, some one seized her by her shoulders,
and, pulling her violently backwards, threw her on
the floor.</p>

<p>“She was then gripped by the throat (so firmly
that the impressions of the fingers could be seen
next day), and on looking up she encountered the
same awful face she had seen in the conservatory.</p>

<p>“The hateful thing was now in full possession of
a body which, blue and hairy, accorded well with
the strangely animal expression in its eyes.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Belmont was too fascinated and horror-stricken
to struggle, and she thinks she would
undoubtedly have been strangled had not succour
once again arrived at the most opportune moment.</p>

<p>“Her rescuer this time was Bruce, a very
pugnacious Irish terrier.</p>

<p>“Nothing daunted, and contrary to what one is
led to expect from the generality of psychic tales,
Bruce flew at the figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“The phantasm immediately dissolved into a blue
vapour and vanished.</p>

<p>“I could enumerate many other occasions on
which similar occult phenomena occurred in the
house; sometimes the eyeless woman would be
seen gliding down the staircase or heard screaming
in the passages; at other times the blue man would
pounce upon his unsuspecting victims out of some
dark sequestered corner, or frighten them to the
verge of a fit, by simply peering at them through a
door or window—the manifestations always terminating
in a bluish vapour.”</p>

<p>“The house, you say, was quite new,” I observed.</p>

<p>Jarvis nodded.</p>

<p>“Then the history of the hauntings,” I replied,
“must either be in some piece of furniture or in
the ground itself. The blue man with the bestial
expression in his face and tatoo-marks on his arms
suggests to me the probability that he is a phantasm
of an ancient Celt.</p>

<p>“Possibly he was a suicide or murderer; possibly
he was neither, but is merely tied to this earth by
his animal propensities—in either case, he would
hover round the place of his burial, and his naturally
ferocious spirit would be rendered doubly ferocious
at being disturbed.</p>

<p>“The woman, of course, may have been some
one associated with him in this life—the lack of
eyes the sign of some dreadful depravity in her
nature.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_TO_NO_HACKHAM" id="APPENDIX_TO_NO_HACKHAM"></a>APPENDIX TO NO. — HACKHAM
TERRACE, SWINDON</h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">At</span> Jarvis’s request, I related to him the story of
“The Screaming Woman of Tehiddy,” taken from
a collection of remarkable narratives on the certainty
of supernatural visitations from the dead to the
living, impartially compiled from the works of
Baxter, Wesley, Simpson, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I chose this tale as the least hackneyed and best
authenticated of the many accounts I had heard of
similar occult phenomena. It is given in the
original text, the extracts being taken from the letter
of one “S.&nbsp;W.” to his friend “Charles.”</p>

<p>“I had occasion one day,” he writes, “to visit the
hamlet of Barnley, some miles distant from Tehiddy,
where I was staying with some relations. My stay
was unexpectedly prolonged till a late hour, and
having promised to be at home before night, I was
compelled to set out on my return much after the
period at which it ought to have been commenced.
Part of my road lay through a thick and lonely forest,
and I confess that the task of traversing it would
have been more agreeable at an earlier opportunity.</p>

<p>“My spirits were affected from some indefinable
cause, and the chill, dark journey I was preparing to
take did not tend to raise them. I swallowed a
hasty cup of coffee with my friend, shook him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
cordially by the hand, and mounting my horse, was
soon at a considerable distance from his house.</p>

<p>“I was approaching the verge of the forest, and
had just entered a narrow outlet from it, when I
heard the roll of distant thunder and felt the wet
and heavy droppings of a copious rain. Having
scarcely a league farther to travel before I reached
home, I determined to urge my horse to the utmost,
and escape, if possible, by his speed, from the impending
storm. He broke at once into a gallop,
when I struck him with the spur, but had scarcely
gone a hundred paces before I was thrown from
the saddle by his abrupt stopping, and pitched with
the greatest violence to the ground. I lay stunned
for a few moments by the fall; the first thing that
brought me to a sense of my situation was a <em>hoarse
scream</em>, uttered by some person who breathed close
to my ear. The rein, which I had continued to
grasp in falling, was at that moment torn violently
out of my hand—I heard the noise of my courser’s
hoofs as he started back—the scream was repeated,
and something rushed past me that clanked as it
went like a horseman’s heavy iron-cased sabre. I
sprang up from the earth and threw out my arms
to ascertain if any individual were actually passing;
but the avenue was so narrow that I touched the
hedges on each side of it, and felt instantly convinced
that nothing human could have gone by. A
recollection now flashed upon me that there was a
tale of extreme horror connected with this part of
the forest, and in spite of the principles which I
summoned to my aid, it was in a mood of mingled
desperation and amazement that I reflected on the
circumstances with which my memory supplied me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“The infirmary of Tehiddy, about twenty years
ago, contained a female patient who was known by
the name of Martha, and had been admitted to that
asylum at the instance of a stranger. He stated
himself to be her husband, and assured the director
of the institution, with the appearance of the deepest
sorrow, that she laboured under a lunacy of the most
stubborn sort, which nothing but the most severe discipline
attributed to his house was likely to abate.</p>

<p>“He advanced a large sum for the maintenance
of this unhappy creature, saw her lodged in one of
the strongest cells of the establishment, and, having
recommended an unsparing use of the scourge,
thought proper to depart. His meaning was not
misunderstood. The shrieks of poor Martha were
heard day and night in the vicinity of her dungeon,
and suspicions soon prevailed that she was being
sacrificed to the cruelty of her merciless keepers.
An investigation of the case was proposed by some
humane and spirited people, but a calamity of the
most awful kind put a stop to their endeavours.
Martha was found dead on the borders of the forest,
at the very spot I have described to you, a piece of
ragged iron being clenched in her grasp, with which
she had torn and gashed her throat in a dreadful
manner. The escape of this wretched being was
never well explained, and hints were dropped that
she had not left the prison alive. Her bloody and
mangled remains excited a strong sensation among
those who inspected them. Marks of the chain and
the whip were conspicuous on every part of her
body, and long tufts of her thin grey hair were
glued together by the stream that had issued from a
deep fracture in her head. The tokens of suicide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
however, were undeniable, and the remains of the
poor maniac were in consequence buried near the
place where they were found.</p>

<p>“This occurrence had scarcely ceased to be the
subject of conversation, when the whole town of
Tehiddy was agitated by events of a yet more appalling
character. <em>Hoarse screams</em> were heard in the
still dark hours of night, and a pale bloodless face
was seen pressing against several of the chamber
windows. Fraud or delusion were naturally suspected
in a business of this nature, and the most
scrutinising inquiries were made into the evidence
on which it rested. No detection took place, and
the screams soon became so frequent that not a
person continued to question their existence.</p>

<p>“It was midnight when I reached home, exhausted
by anxiety and fatigue, and, being provided with a
key to my apartments, the people of the house had
not waited up to receive me. I drew off my boots
and upper coat as a preliminary to the act of
undressing, and seated myself in a large antique
chair, from which, when divested of my clothes, I
usually stepped into bed. Here I fell asleep owing
to excessive weariness, and may the next slumber that
is likely to end in so horrible a way be never broken.</p>

<p>“A dream was upon me full of blood and death;
the shrieking maniac flitted through my brain in a
thousand forms, and seemed, at one time, to stand
over me brandishing a sword of fire.</p>

<p>“The next moment, I lay benumbed, as it were,
in my seat, while the maniac advanced from a dark
corner of the room, bearing in her right hand a
human skull replete with some poisonous sort of
drink. This horrible potion was lifted to my lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
which seemed to shut in vain against it, the long,
bony fingers of the phantom being thrust into my
mouth, so as to force a passage for her accursed
mixture. It trickled down to my very heart in slow,
cold drops, and when lodged there seemed, by a
sudden transition, to burn and glow like flames of
Etna; spellbound as I was, such extreme agony
passed my powers of endurance. I uttered a frantic
cry and sprang up from the chair, darting towards
the hag by whom my torment was inflicted. The
glare of her red eyes grew stronger as I advanced,
and a lean, sallow arm was put out to repel me.
Fearing the detested touch, I hastily drew back; some
article of furniture intercepted me; I fell, and was
plunged from the fall into a chasm, which opened
through the floor. The shock of this awoke me,
and the first proof I obtained of my actual perception
was the sound of that <em>hoarse scream</em> which a
few hours before had been uttered in the forest.
This scream was repeated—it seemed to issue from
the windows. I heard the casement flap, as if a
strong wind were shaking it; and though my
sinews shrank and withered at the noise, yet I
staggered to this window as fast as my feet would
carry me. A ray of light flashed in as I reached it,
and there, pressed close against the glass, I saw the
same pale, bloodless visage that has been already
figured to you.</p>

<p>“Maddened by the sight, I clenched my hand and
drove it fiercely at the apparition.</p>

<p>“Its lips quivered—the <em>scream</em> rang again through
the apartment. I was found next day without sense
or motion, my hand dreadfully cut, and the window
shivered to pieces.”</p>

<span class="stl">THE CAVALIER’S GHOST</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Technical form of apparition: Phantasm of the dead</p>

<p>Source of authenticity: Miscellaneous collection of
Ghost Stories by Baxter, Wesley and Simpson</p>

<p>Cause of haunting: Murder</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot3">
<p>(The following story is told <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad verbum</i> in the language
of the eye-witness, the quaintness of his style being
accounted for by the period in which he lived.)</p>
</div>


<p>“I was always a very strong-minded man, and, until
the time about which I am going to speak, always
ridiculed the idea of ghosts.</p>

<p>“You must know that about two years ago<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I
went to lodge at an ancient house in Westminster,
where nothing remarkable happened to me for
about three months; and then, on a night in
November (too well do I remember it), I saw such
an appalling sight as I never before beheld.</p>

<p>“Even were I starving to-morrow, I would not
again enter that room—no, not for a thousand
pounds! I had been to the theatre, and on my
way home had drunk a single pint of porter, so
that no doubt of my sobriety can exist for a
moment.</p>

<p>“My room was on the second storey of a house
that, I should suppose, had weathered well-nigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
four hundred years, and was in former days an
isolated habitation.</p>

<p>“The room, surrounded by a wainscoting of oak
to the height of five feet, was very lofty, and even
in the lightest days, owing to the narrowness of
the windows, was extremely gloomy. As I said
before, I returned from the theatre, and the snuff
of the candle, which I had extinguished on getting
into bed, had not ceased to emit its disagreeable
effluvia when I beheld—my blood freezes when I
think of it—a young man, dressed in the habit of
days gone by, gliding through the wainscoting on
the opposite side of the apartment to where I lay.</p>

<p>“I was completely paralysed—trembled violently
in every limb—and the perspiration fell in torrents
from my brows.</p>

<p>“I felt for some time as if every nerve was cut
asunder and every sense benumbed.</p>

<p>“I exerted myself to speak, but in vain; my
tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth, and I was
obliged to remain a horror-stricken and inactive
spectator of the scene before me.</p>

<p>“The apparition remained for nearly ten minutes,
which was ample time for me to convince myself
that it was no idle chimera of a diseased imagination
that stood before me. Yet although it remained so
long a time, I could not command sufficient resolution
to challenge it or summon any one to my
aid—for I felt as though deprived of all energy, and,
in fact, I was so during the whole time of its visit,
though my sense of perception and consciousness
were painfully acute.</p>

<p>“The expression of the countenance was peculiarly
mild, and the rich dark locks falling about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
forehead and shoulders, and the mustachios of the
same hue, showed in horrid relief against the ashy,
chilling, and livid hue of the face.</p>

<p>“He wore a doublet of a kind of chocolate colour,
richly embroidered with gold lace, full loose breeches
of a yellow leather, ornamented uniformly with the
doublet, and from each was suspended a bunch of
ribbon, adorned with a metal tag, reaching down
nearly to the broad and drooping tops of his light
russet boots.</p>

<p>“A large travelling-cloak of dark blue cloth reached
from the shoulders down to the heels, hanging in
full folds over the left arm, which was extended
towards the fireplace of my apartment.</p>

<p>“While I was gazing on him in stupid astonishment
and terror, he raised his right hand, and lifting
from his head his broad, sable-feathered hat, discovered
to my agonising sight a deep and bloody
wound in the centre of the forehead.</p>

<p>“This action he then followed up with sighs and
gesticulations which, although I could not clearly
understand, were apparently intended to warn me of
some impending danger.</p>

<p>“Harrowing as the sight was to my feelings, it was
a mere nothing to what I suffered when I beheld
him advance, slowly and almost imperceptibly, towards
the spot where I lay, and fixing his dark,
piercing gaze upon me for nearly a minute, hold me
in a more painful and horrid inactivity than that in
which the basilisk is said to hold its victim.</p>

<p>“Although I knew from the expression in his eyes
he wished me to speak, and much as I desired to
hear from him some of the mysteries attached to the
superphysical world, I could not articulate a sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
(a phenomenon which I have since learned invariably
happens to psychists at the crucial moment).</p>

<p>“At length he retired towards the wainscot, and
raising both his hands in the attitude of prayer,
remained apparently wrapped in deep contemplation
for nearly three minutes, and then suddenly disappeared—sinking
into the floor at the bottom of the
wainscotting. As you may well suppose, I did not
close my eyes again that night, but as soon as it was
light I proceeded to my landlord’s room, roused
him, and demanded to settle my account, for I determined
in my own mind never to re-enter the house
which was visited in so superhuman a manner.</p>

<p>“With astonishment in his countenance, he received
the amount of my rent, at the same time
inquiring what had caused this sudden aversion to
my apartment.</p>

<p>“I answered evasively, and as I left him I thought
I observed a kind of lurking consciousness of something
wrong in his countenance, which led me to
surmise he was fully aware of the mysterious visits
of the apparition; and so it proved in the end, for,
happening to meet him one day in the park, I
inveigled him into confessing that it was reported
in the neighbourhood that the house, and particularly
the room in which I slept, was haunted by the
troubled spirit of a young cavalier of King Charles
the Second’s days, said to have been murdered there.
‘And,’ he added, ‘during the time he had kept the
house, no less than nine people had left the apartment
on account of the disturbances. He had
concealed this from me,’ he concluded, ‘fearing I
might add one more to the list of lodgers scared
away by the supernatural vision.’”</p>

<h2><a name="GLOSSARY" id="GLOSSARY"></a>GLOSSARY</h2>


<div class="glossary">
<p><span class="smcap">Elemental.</span> Otherwise known as Poltergeist. There are
too many species of this genus of spirit for me to
attempt a classification in this work. Broadly defined,
an Elemental is a phantasm that has never inhabited
any kind of earthly body whether animal or vegetable.
It may be sub-human, as in the case of the Clock-ghost
of Mulready; sub-animal, as in the case of the
Guilsborough apparition; or sub-vegetable, as in the
case of the <span class="lowcap">ACTINOMYCES</span> phenomenon near Bath.</p>

<p class="ind">It is generally, but not always inimically disposed
towards man. One type of it, viz., the gnome, pixie, &amp;c.,
avoid humanity as much as possible; other types are
merely mischievous, delighting to frighten children by
visiting their nurseries or pouncing out upon them
when at play in some deserted building or lonely by-road;
whilst other species are wholly evil, generating
bacilli of foul diseases or urging man to the commission
of vicious acts and crime. Their origin I reserve for
another volume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> The general name for phantasms, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hallucination.</span> Any supposed sensory perception that
has no objective counterpart within field of vision,
hearing, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clairvoyance.</span> The faculty or art of perceiving some
distant scene as though an actual eye-witness. A
clairvoyant is often able to describe (unconsciously)
what he is witnessing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delusion.</span> Fancy. When one imagines one sees or
hears something and it exists <span class="lowcap">ONLY</span> in imagination.
Hallucinations are either delusive, when there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to which they correspond in the objective world, or
veridical, when they correspond with events taking
place somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Illusion.</span> Misinterpretation of some object actually
present to the sight, as, for example, when a cloak
hanging on a peg is mistaken for a man, or a ringing
in the ears for sounds of bells.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Metetherical World.</span> The world beyond the ether,
synonyms—spiritual, superphysical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phantasm.</span> A ghost. Any occult phenomenon that is
either visual or auditory as distinct from a phantom
which is only visual: or, indeed, any superphysical
presence that conveys the impression of touch,
smell, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suggestion.</span> Process of impressing upon a person’s
intelligence or mind the thoughts and wishes of another
intelligence or mind; or ideas engendered by the
appearance of certain localities, furniture, &amp;c., or simply
by the atmosphere.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
